<!-- ## Presentation {.unnumbered} -->

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the WildHealth Database (WHeDB), covering its data structure (data model), the web-based graphical user interface for general users, and the data dictionary. Our goal is to offer a clear understanding of WHeDB’s organization, functionality, and data semantics.

**WHeDB** is a versatile platform designed to manage wildlife health data from diverse surveillance efforts. These efforts include:

* Citizen observations of dead, injured, or sick animals
* Research studies focused on wildlife health
* National and local monitoring surveillance programs
* Outbreak investigations
* Global surveillance initiatives spanning multiple countries, hazards, and host species

The version 1 of the data model structuring the data in **WHeDB**  has been developed by the **Wildlife Health Intelligence Network - Data Task Force**. This Data Task Force is composed by members of the Wildlife Conservation Society, the World Organisation of Animal Health, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Administration, the University of Calgary, the Davis Arbovirus Research and Training (University of California - Davis), the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. This collective expertise spans wildlife health surveillance activities conducted in numerous countries with several public and private partners using cross-sectional and longitudinal strategies; the establishment of wildlife health surveillance networks; assessment of diverse biological, chemical, and physical hazards; zoonotic disease research (e.g., Ebola, SARS-CoV-2); engagement of rangers in protected areas and nearby communities as key contributors to health surveillance; diagnostic development and testing, wildlife pathology, and wildlife data management using different information management systems. 


The documentation is structured as follows:

**Data Model** – A detailed overview of **WHeDB’s** data structure, enabling users to effectively enter, navigate, and manage data in the database.

**Data Dictionary** – A reference guide listing and describing all data elements, including their names, types, and constraints, to ensure consistency and clarity.

**Database Manual** – Step-by-step guidance on using the graphical user interface to access, read, write, edit, delete, and manage data.
