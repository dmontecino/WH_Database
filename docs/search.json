    "text": "WildlifeHealthDat is a versatile database designed to manage wildlife health data collected from various surveillance efforts. These efforts encompass a wide range of activities, including citizen observations of dead, injured, or sick animals, specific research studies, national or local wildlife health surveillance initiatives, outbreak investigations, and global wildlife health surveillance projects involving multiple countries, hazards, and host species\nThe database draws upon the extensive experience of the Wildlife Conservation Society - Health Program, which spans several decades. This experience includes wildlife health surveillance activities conducted in numerous countries with several public and private partners; both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies; the establishment of wildlife health surveillance networks; investigation of diverse biological, chemical, and physical hazards; research on dangerous zoonotic pathogens like Ebola virus disease and SARS-CoV-2; first detection of emerging vector-borne pathogens such as West Nile virus; engagement of rangers in protected areas and nearby communities as key contributors to health surveillance; logistical challenges related to proper management, storage, and tracking of field-collected specimens; expertise in wildlife pathology; the use and development of various types of diagnostic tests, and prior experience in managing wildlife health data using different information management systems.\nThe wildlife health information is organized within the database using a structured hierarchy of components, starting from the highest level of “Projects” down to “Surveillance Objectives,” “Field Activities,” “Locations,” “Incidents,” “Sources,” “Records,” “Specimens,” and “Diagnostics.” While there are four types of sources in the database, it is modular in nature, allowing for customization and selection of specific components based on the requirements of each surveillance initiative. Briefly, Projects are a set of surveillance activities with a common leader and organizer (e.g., a national veterinary services agency). The Surveillance Activity is a surveillance effort that have a specific methodology and objective. The Field Visit represents a period when surveillance activities are conducted. The Location is a specific area where surveillance activities are conducted. An Event is a site where wildlife health surveillance data is collected from. Sources are the units that can present disease and provide specimens for hazard detection or sites where specimens can be collected directly to assess hazards in the environment or in the arthropods. Specimens are the tissue taken from the Sources. Diagnostics are the tests conducted in Animals, Carcasses, or Specimens collected to assess Hazards. Diagnosis are the final status assigned to a Diagnostic, a Specimen, or a Source with respect to the Hazards surveyed based on case definitions. Detailed explanations of each component are provided in the following sections."

In this case the components of this Field Visit should be assigned to a scanning surveillance Surveillance Activity (the original purpose) and to the Outbreak Surveillance Activity.

Each Field Visit can encompass multiple Surveillance Objectives (as described above) and involve visits to various types of Locations, such as markets, natural areas, rehabilitation centers, caves, and more. The Field Visit requires an end date which can be placed in the future. For example, a Surveillance Activity aims to assess the body condition of a herd on a yearly for a decade. In this case, each Field Visit can encompass each full year, with an assigned start date of January 1st and en date December 31st of the corresponding year. The end date can be assigned in any moment before December 31st during the year, when the Field Visit is created."

    "text": "A Location refers to a general place where Events, Source Records, Carcasses, and Specimens can be collected. During a single Field Visit, data may be collected from various Locations, such as two rehabilitation centers, a cave within a protected area, or three different zones within another protected area. In this case, there would be a total of six Locations. Therefore, a Location serves as a way to group data in a more generalized manner compared to the exact latitude and longitude coordinates where data is collected (‘Event’; see below), but it provides more specificity than the overall ‘Field Activity’.\nWhat a ‘Location’ represents will inevitably vary depending on the Surveillance Activity methodology. For example, for the collection of arthropods, a Location can represent a parcel where traps are set. In a structured research, the Location could represent a grid cell. In scanning surveillance by rangers, the Location can correspond to either the full protected area, or the specific zone within the protected area. It is up to the users to define what unit the Location represents and report it in the Surveillance Activity metadata. Locations can be grouped in larger groups below the Field Visit if needed. For a detail explanation, see “Grouping of Locations, Events, and Source Records”"

    "title": "Event",
    "section": "",
    "text": "An Event refers to a distinct wildlife health event that occurs at a specific longitude and latitude on a particular date.\nThe definition of a wildlife health event, and thus the concept of an ‘Incident,’ varies depending on the Surveillance Objective methodology. In targeted surveillance efforts, an Incident may involve sampling healthy animals within a specific time and space to test them for a specific hazard. The inclusion of non-sampled individuals, as well as injured, sick, or dead animals, may or may not be considered part of the Incident.\nIf samples are collected from a river, the ‘Incident’ can be considered the location where the water is extracted. In the case of surveillance for vector-borne diseases, an Incident might represent a specific point in time and space where one or several traps for vectors have been placed. In scanning surveillance, an Incident could require the presence of at least one injured, sick, or dead animal, or a stranded individual. Additionally, healthy individuals found in the vicinity can also be included as part of the ‘Incident.’\nIn the case of beached fish, an Incident can represent each individual dead fish at one extreme, or the total count of dead fish across the beach as a single point in time and space at the other extreme. However, neither of these strategies is ideal. The former is not suitable for logistical purposes, while the latter results in the loss of valuable information regarding the distribution of dead fish across the beach. Therefore, an Incident should represent a unit between these two extremes.\nSimilarly, in the context of a wet market, the market can represent simultaneously an Incident and a Location. This Incident can gather data from multiple vendors, cages, and animals within the cages. On the other hand, a market could be considered a Location only, and each individual vendor within the market could be considered an Incident.\nA structured study can have multiple levels of hierarchy (zone, grid, area, trap, etc.) and one level receives the temporal-spatial coordinates (Incident). Another similarly structured study may provide the spatial coordinate to a different unit (e.g., area in one case and trap in another case).\nConsequently, an Incident can represent a wide range of units depending on the methodology used to record health data. Therefore, it is crucial to allow flexibility in what an Incident represents within a surveillance design and to explicitly declare its meaning as part of their data.\nIn the case of markets or structured studies, it may be desirable to group Incidents more specifically than simply under the general ‘Location’ category. For example, a market can be considered a ‘Location,’ and each cage could be treated as an ‘Incident.’ Users might want to further group cages by vendors and vendors by specific areas within the market. Similarly, in a structured study, the ‘Incident’ could represent a trap, and researchers may wish to group these Incidents based on areas, grid cells, zones, and seasons. Therefore, the database includes multiple ‘Incident’ tags to enable grouping on a finer scale than just the general ‘Location.’ Users can request specific tags as needed.\nIncidents can lack of any Sources (see below) if nothing is captured or sampled, but they can also have multiple Source Records of any type, depending on the specific findings and the interests of the corresponding Surveillance Objective."

    "text": "Observation\nAn Observation corresponds to the observed-only animal(s) present at one Incident grouped by species. For example, a wildlife health event involving a single isolated injured animal. If this individual is observed only, then the Incident has a single Observation representing a single species. The animal count for that single species is one.\nAnother example: five animals are found in a wetland, two of them of species “A” and three of them of species “B”. One animal of species “A” is sick. If they are only observed and the Surveillance Objective is not interested in individual animal-level data, then this set of findings is a wildlife health ‘Incident’ with two ‘Observations’. One ‘Observation’ represents species “A” (one healthy individual and one sick animal), and another ‘Observation’ represents species “B” (three healthy individuals).\nIncidents can include Observations (species) with healthy animals only, as long as they are part of a wildlife health event.\nEach Observation generates one and only one Source Record with immutable data. In that unique Source Record animals are categorized by sex, age, and health status. The captivity categories of the corresponding animals; their anomalies; and potential causes of injury, disease, or dead can be provided.\nIf the same set of only-observed animals is believed to be found five days later, then a new Observation must be created because there is no certainty that they are the same individuals. If users want to track the animals longitudinally, they should be added singly to the database as ‘Animal Source’ (see below)."

    "section": "Animal Source",
    "text": "Animal Source\nAn Animal Source represents an individual animal whose specific data is wanted. Individually-traceable Specimens can be collected from Animal Sources, including the full carcass to have a Necropsy completed. Animal Source data includes the species, the identifier, the cross identifier, the sex, and the date of death (see Data Dictionary). Past marking codes (if any have been used) are considered immutable and added to the Animal Source.\nAn example of Animal Sources are animals of different or the same species in a cage located in a live market. If the data of the animals is to be collected at the individual-level, then each individual of either species represent an Animal Group Source in the cage. Another example are two dead animals found by rangers patrolling a protected area with a rectal swab taken from each one of them.\n\nAnimal Source Record\nAn Animal Source Record consists of an Animal Source at time t. Properties of an Animal Source Record are its age, health status, observed anomalies, and potential cause of disease or death if they apply at time t, among others (see Data Dictionary). The marking of an individual animal at time t is considered mutable and a property of the corresponding Animal Source Record. Properties of an Animal Source Record can have single or multiple qualifications For example, the observed health status in only one but an Animal Source Record can receive several anomalies.\nAn Animal Source can be either dead, diseased, poisoned, infected, injured, or healthy at time t. An Animal Source Record with an observed health status “healthy” can be part of an Event if they are of interest (e.g., a healthy animal of species X next to dead animals of species X, Y, and Z).\nAn animal of species X documented as an Animal Source Record cannot be included in a Group Source Record of animals of species X and vice-versa (Sources types are mutually exclusive at time t). The total number of animals of species X in the Event-Effort unit that contains a Group Source Record of species X and Animal Source Records of species X, is the sum of animals of species X in the Group Source Record (one Record per species unit per Event) and the number of Animal Source Records of species X. An example is a herd of cows illegally raised in a protected area whose health is assessed at time t. The herd contains 20 cows, two of them are sampled, and the rest are part of a single unit. In this case, the Event has two Animal Source Records (corresponding to the two sampled cows) and a single Group Source Record that distributes 18 cows per sex, age, and health status.\n\n\nAnimal Source Specimens\nAnimal Sources can provide Specimens at time t (see “Specimens”) and they should be traceable at the individual level. An example are feces collected from the bottom of a cage with animals of the same species, and it was observed which animal dropped them. If Specimens cannot be traced to a single animal but to a group of them, the Specimens should be associated with a Group Source (see above).\nThe date of death of an Animal Source Record is not necessarily the last time it can provide Specimens because it is possible to collect them from the carcass (dead Animal Source).\n\n\nCarcass\n\n\nNecropsy\nA Necropsy is associated with a specific Animal Source Record that can occur any date after the corresponding Animal is found dead.\nNecropsies can be primary or secondary. Primary necropsies usually start with an intact carcass (not previously used in a necropsy). Secondary necropsies are usually conducted by a veterinarian pathologist using pictures of the primary necropsy or using a carcass already necropsied.\nNew Specimens can be generated during a Necropsy (e.g., samples from organs). In this case, the date of Specimen collection is not the date of the Animal Source Record when the carcass was collected, but the date of the Necropsy (primary or secondary). It is possible to track if a Specimen was collected during the primary or secondary Necropsy based on the information collected in Specimens (see below)."

Environmental Sources do not have sex or date of death.\nImmutable data for Environmental Sources are the species (in the case of biotic Environmental Sources) and the Environmental Source type. Setting the Environmental Source type determines the Specimen type provided for those Sources (see ‘Specimens’ below). For example, feces can only yield feces as Specimens, and water in a pond can only provide water.\n\nEnvironmental Source Record\nEach Environmental Source has at least one Source Record. This first Source Record corresponds to the unique collection from an unidentified Environmental Source (e.g., feces on the ground) or to the first record of an individually identified Environmental Source (e.g., water collected at a specific place in the pond). Individually Environmental Sources can potentially be tracked over time and have as many Source Records as needed.\nEnvironmental Sources do not have mutable data except for the time t when they are sampled."

If the same type of trap is placed in the same coordinates, then Invertebrate Sources can be tracked longitudinally; however, the invertebrate species collected each time the trap is set can be different. Invertebrate Sources do not have sex, age, captivity category, anomalies, health status, potential cause of death, etc.\nAn Invertebrate Source contains data from a collection of invertebrates. If the interest is at the individual level (e.g., bees with problems in their wings), then the user should add Animal Sources.\n\nInvertebrate Source Record\nEach Invertebrate Source has at least one Source Record. This first Source Record corresponds to setting the type of trap in specific coordinates. As mentioned in the previous section, if the same type of invertebrate trap is placed in the same coordinates, then Invertebrate Sources can be tracked over time and have as many Source Records as needed. If the type of trap changes, then it is a different Invertebrate Source.\nMutable data needs to be provided for each Invertebrate Source Record.

    "text": "Final Comment on Sources and Source Records\nUsers can group Source Records from different Sources beyond the Incident they belong to. For example, a Surveillance Objective involves sampling animals and cages in a market as part of targeted surveillance efforts. One of the potential options to structure these data is to set the market as the Location and set each vendor within the market as an ‘Incident’. Let’s pretend that in one of the Incidents (a vendor), a sample of feces is collected from the bottom of a cage, the cage has three animals of the same species, and only one of those animals is sampled (one oral swab sample).\nUnder this scenario, the cage is providing three Source Records. Firstly, an Environmental Source with a single Environmental Source Record containing the feces sampled from the bottom of the cage. Secondly, an Observation with the two animals in the cage that are only observed (Observations always have a single Record). And thirdly, an Animal Source with a single Animal Source Record containing the oral swab.\nHow to track that these Source Records belong to the same cage? The database provides tags per user request that allow to label Sources Records that belong to units lower than Incidents and keep them linked. In the example, the three Source Records can receive the same tag (“cage1”) in order to track that they have a more specific origin than Incident.\nAn Animal Source Record has data of a single animal always, which might or might not be identified individually and tracked over time.\nEnvironmental and\nIn te case of env and arthropod sources, they could be equivalent to the location.\nIncidents can include Observations (species) with healthy animals only, as long as they are part of a wildlife health event.\nEach Observation generates one and only one Source Record with immutable data. In that unique Source Record animals are categorized by sex, age, and health status. The captivity categories of the corresponding animals; their anomalies; and potential causes of injury, disease, or dead can be provided.\nDisgnostic test - visual assessment of death, sick injured? what about the potential causes of death?"

    "text": "Specimens refer to the materials collected from Source Records for the purpose of conducting Diagnostics to identify hazards (biological, chemical, physical) or physiological problems. Specimens can range from the entire body of a living animal for conducting an ultrasound on to a minimal amount of tissue to perform advanced assays.\nSpecimens are characterized by an identifier, the type of material (water, hair, kidney, animal), the original amount (e.g., ‘full animal’ or 0.35 mm), the solution used for preservation, and the storage type in the field and in the storage location. Additionally, the database tracks the strorage location of the Specimens (building, laboratory name, refrigerator name, etc.), their availability, ownership, and current amount. It is important to note that the original amount and the current amount of a Specimen may differ if a portion of the original Specimen has already been used for Diagnostics.\nFor Animal Specimens that are equivalent to the Animal Source Record (both representing the ‘full animal’), information should be provided at both the Source Record and Specimen levels. The Source Record and Specimen can have the same identifier or different identifiers, and the amount of the Specimen in such cases should be indicated as ‘full animal’.\nInvertebrate Source Records may include multiple species; however, it is expected that the Specimens associated with these Records only contain invertebrates of the same species.\nSpecimens with a current amount of zero should not be deleted from the database, and their last known storage location should be retained.\nIn situations where space or materials are limited, it is possible that multiple Specimens are stored in the same container. This approach is not ideal because it can lead to cross-contamination and make actual Specimen tracing more complex. To address the tracing of these Specimens, a unique container identifier, such as a jar identifier, can be added in the database. Specimens sharing the same container will have the same container identifier. Although individual Specimens within the same container may not be labeled individually, each Specimen should be given a unique Specimen Code in the database. This Code can be the same as the container identifier, followed by the “organ name” or a numeric string (e.g., “.1”, “.2”, etc.). Specific details for each individual Specimen within the container, such as type, quantity, etc, should allow their visual identification within the container."

    "text": "Diagnostics encompass various techniques used to identify hazards (biological, chemical, physical) or physiological problems in Specimens obtained from Source Records. Each Diagnostic is designed for a specific targeted hazard, such as a viral family or a particular virus species. Diagnostics include three main components: type, method, and result.\nThe type of Diagnostic refers to a general category of diagnostic techniques, such as histopathology, serology, or imaging. Within each type, there are specific methods available, such as biopsy, ELISA assays, or X-rays. These methods can be applied at different levels, such as organs, serum, or specific body areas, respectively. This variability causes Specimens to range from full animals to a small sample.\nEach diagnostic method should provide a single result. However, it is possible to modify a diagnostic result in the database and provide a reason for the change.\nThe result of a Diagnostic should adhere to the case definition criteria established in the corresponding Surveillance Objective metadata for each declared method. Whenever possible, it is ideal to include supporting information such as digital images or files to corroborate the entered result in the database. If Diagnostics are performed under a new Surveillance Objective, such as testing a Specimen collected 50 years ago, this information must be provided in the Diagnostic data.

    "section": "Group Source",
    "text": "Group Source\nA Group Source is a unit of co-specific individuals (animals of the same species) that belong to the same epidemiologicla unit, are observed, and can provide Specimens. Group Sources can be associated to an area, a site, a farm, a cage, a stall, an enclosure, or another unit that allows to group animals of the same species as an epidemiological unit. Data of a Group Source include the species, the identifier, the cross identifier, and the date of extinction (see Data Dictionary). An example of Group Sources are animals of two species in a cage located in a live market. Animals of each species represent a Group Source in the cage. Another example are two herds of wild herbivores of the same species that are identified as “group 37” and “group 38” living in specific area of the Arctic. As a consequence, an Event-Effort unit can have more than one Group Source of the same species if it contains animals of the same species that are distributed in different epidemiological units and, therefore, Group Sources.\n\nGroup Source Record\nA Group Source Record consists of a count of the animals in the Group Source at time t, stratified by sex, age, and health status (e.g., healthy, injured, sick, or dead), observed anomalies, potential causes of disease or death if they apply at time t, among others (see Data Dictionary). Each property of Group Source Records can receive multiple options. For example, a Group Source with three dead animals can receive several potential causes of death. Group Source Records can include a mix of dead, diseased, poisoned, infected, injured, and healthy individuals or one of these categories exclusively, including healthy animals only if they are of interest (e.g., animals of species X with all of them observed healthy next to dead animals of species Y and Z).\nGroup Source Records can have a single individual. For example, rangers patrolling a protected area find at the same site (Event) a dead animal of species X and two dead animals of species Y. For the data model of the database, this corresponds to a single Event with a specific Effort and records of two Group Sources. One with the single dead animal of species X and another one the two dead animals of species Y.\nAn animal of species X documented as part of a Group Source Record cannot be included as an Animal Source Record and vice-versa at time t (Sources types are mutually exclusive at time t). The total number of animals of species X in the Event-Effort unit that contains a Group Source Record of species X and Animal Source Records of species X, is the sum of animals of species X in the Group Source Record (one Record per species unit per Event) and the number of Animal Source Records of species X. An example is a herd of cows illegally raised in a protected area whose health is assessed at time t. The herd contains 20 cows, two of them are sampled, and the rest are part of a single unit. In this case, the Event has two Animal Source Records (corresponding to the two sampled cows) and a single Group Source Record that distributes 18 cows per sex, age, and health status.\nProperties of a Group Source Record are documented at the group level. Therefore, it is not possible to know the distribution of several properties across individuals of the Group Source Record, but only that it was present in at least one individual (the exception is the species and also other properties when a Group Source is composed by a single individual). If the user wants to record properties at the individual level, there are two options. The first one is to document Animal Source Records (see below) to document each animal of a Group singly with their corresponding properties. The second option is to record only animals showing symptoms as Animal Source Records and the rest of healthy animals of the same species as a Group Source Record. This second option is not recommended for Group Sources tracked over time because animals recorded as Animal Sources at time t might not show any symptoms at time t’ and would be part of the Group Source Record at time t’.\n\n\nGroup Source Specimens\nGroup Sources can provide Specimens at time t (see “Specimens”) but they should not be traceable at the individual level but at the group level. An example are feces collected from the bottom of a cage with animals of the same species. In this case, it is not possible to know which individual dropped the feces; however, there is information of the species and the observed health status of animals, including the unknown individual that dropped them. Sex and age of the animals could be known too. If Specimens can be traced to a single animal, they should be associated with an Animal Source (see below).\nThe last date a Group Source was observed is not necessarily the last time the Group Source can provide Specimens. For example, it is possible to collect feces from an empty cage that the Group Source was using until two days ago. In consequence, the age, sex, and health status distribution of the Group Source Record can be all unknown."
