<p>The Wildlife Health Data Model (WHEDMO) is a data model that aims to accommodate wildlife health data coming from different sources, including local to national wildlife health surveillance systems (surveillance of diseases, pathogens, and toxins), research initiatives, or citizen-science based projects, among others.</p>
<p>Wildlife health surveillance systems can include a wide range of methods and targets. The plethora of surveillance types (general surveillance, targeted surveillance, participatory surveillance, sentinel surveillance, early warning surveillance, syndromic surveillance, etc) reflects the potential variability of the strategies, methodologies, and objectives associated with health assessment in wildlife. The strategies can include information from open sources, community members, and ranger patrols. Active capture of animals or the testing of specimen from wild animals in markets and collection of specimens of different types could be part of the strategies as well. The methodologies can focus in pure observations of herds and animals, hosts or vectors, the collection of carcasses to conduct necropsies, multiple diagnostic tests, among others. The objectives can range from early detection of pathogens, measure of disease levels and their impacts, prove absence of disease, evaluate disease control methods, etc. Furthermore, the variability with respect to the potential targeted populations and hazards (biological, chemical, physical, or physiological) support the creation of “infinite” types of data.</p>
<!-- # Figure data inputs -->
<p>On the other hand, harmonization of data and systems to effectively track, store, retrieve and disseminate information are foundational pillars of wildlife health surveillance systems. However, both pillars have being absent historically and globally. The challenge is evident. Promote best data practices when data are multiple and variable. The Wildlife Health Intelligence Network has develop a data model designed to respond to this challenge.</p>
<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The WHE data model contains units that are hierarchical organized, starting from the highest level of “<strong>Projects</strong>”, followed by “<strong>Surveillance Activities</strong>”, “<strong>Field Visits</strong>”, “<strong>Locations</strong>”, “<strong>Events</strong>”, “<strong>Collections</strong>”, “<strong>Sources</strong>”, “<strong>Source Records</strong>”, “<strong>Specimens</strong>”, and “<strong>Diagnostics</strong>”. Briefly, <strong>Projects</strong> are a set of <strong>Surveillance Activities</strong> with a common leader and organizer (e.g., a national wildlife health surveillance system). <strong>Surveillance Activity</strong> is a surveillance task that have a specific methodology and objectives. <strong>Field Visit</strong> represents a period of time when activities are conducted in the field. The <strong>Location</strong> is a specific area where surveillance activities are conducted. An <strong>Event</strong> is a site where wildlife health surveillance data is collected from. An <strong>Event</strong> can contain different <strong>Collections</strong> that represent different methods and efforts to obtain <strong>Source Records from Sources</strong>. <strong>Sources</strong> are the units that can provide <strong>Specimens</strong> for hazard detection or whose health is assessed by an agent at time <em>t</em>. There are four Source types in the data model: group of animals, individual animals, sites to collect environmental tissue, and sites to collect arthropods. <strong>Specimens</strong> are tissue taken from the <strong>Sources</strong> at time <em>t</em> (<strong>Source Records</strong>). <strong>Diagnostics</strong> are the tests conducted in lived animals (“Animal Source”), <strong>Carcasses</strong>, or <strong>Specimens</strong> collected to assess hazards.</p>
<p>Out of this hierarchy is the component <strong>Diagnosis</strong>, which is the final status assigned to a Diagnostic, a Specimen, or a Source at time <em>t</em> with respect to the hazards surveyed, based on well-documented case definitions. <strong>The basic relationships among the basic units of the data model</strong> are shown in Figure 1 below.</p>
<p><img src="Pictures_and_diagrams/relationship_data_model.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:120.0%"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Basic relationships among the basic units of the data model.</p>
<p>The data model remains simple when the wildlife health data is simple, and it gets more complicated as the data structure and variability increases. For this reason, many components of the data model are conditional, meaning that they are needed depending on the structure of the data. Let’s start with example 1: wildlife mortality reported by a community member through an application. The methodology must be explained in the Surveillance Activity metadata. The Field Visit could be one per year to categorize the reports per year. The Location can be defined by the position sent by the mobile device when each dead animal is recorded. In this case, it could be a county of a zip code. In the example, an Event has Source Records corresponding to dead animals. No Specimen, Diagnostic, or Laboratory data is generated. No Collection effort is associated with the Events, and the animals are not clustered beyond the Field Visit, the Location, and the Events.</p>
<p><img src="Pictures_and_diagrams/simple_example.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:80.0%"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Components of the data model to contain data from example 1.</p>
<!-- The next example is a series of surveys in wildlife farms to identify pathogens. Surveys are conducted every 3 months and each one of them include all the farms in the study. The farms are distributed in several counties. Each farm has several species that are distributed in barns, aisles, pens, and cages. Seasonal changes are assessed as well. All the animals of the cages will be sampled (rectal and oral swab each one). Fecal samples will be collected from the cages directly as well. Finally, each sample will be tested for 3 pathogens. In this example, there could be a single Surveillance Activity with the three pathogens included, or three Surveillance Activities with the same methods except the targeted hazards (one Surveillance Activity per pathogen is recommended). The data includes **Field Visits every three months**. Each one of these Field Visits includes all the counties were the farms are located. If each farm is a Location, then the Locations must be clustered by county. Also, if the Event within each farm is a cage with animals, then the Events must be clustered by pen, aisles, and barns. In the manner the structure of the data is Field Visit, county (cluster), farms (Location), barns (cluster), aisles (cluster), pens (cluster), and cages (Event). Depending on the number of cages per pen, there could be multiple or a unique Event per pen. Each Event will have as many Sources at time *t* as animals are per each cage. Continuing with the animals (Sources), two Specimens are collected from each one of them and they are tested for three pathogens for a total of six tests per individual. Furthermore, each cage Event also has a Group Source Record, corresponding to the animals that are in the cage as a group. This Group Source Record has a fecal Specimen associated also tested for three pathogens. -->
<!-- # Figure first exaple -->
<p>The data model is <strong>not designed for wildlife population monitoring</strong>. However, the data model includes key identifiers so wildlife health and population data can be integrated seamlessly.</p>
<p>More complex relationships among the basic units in the data model, as well as other extra units in the data model are explained in the section “Complexities”. We recommend first to learn more about the units from Project up to Diagnosis by continuing reading this documentation and checking the menu on the top right corner of this website and click on the corresponding unit -&gt;.</p>
</section>
<section id="main-units-of-the-data-model" class="level1">
<h1>Main Units of the Data Model</h1>
<section id="project" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="project">Project</h2>
<!-- # Project {.unnumbered} -->
<p>A Project in the data model is a surveillance initiative supported by specific entities. For example, the PREDICT Project funded by USAID, an isolated cross-sectional study with a single field visit to a single location (sample collection in a market), or a national or local wildlife health surveillance network led by a government agency. Projects are the highest hierarchical unit in the database and they contain at least one Surveillance Activity. Projects can involve a single date or they can extend for as long as needed.</p>
<p>Properties of a Project include the Project ID, Project Code, Project Cross Reference ID, Project Cross Reference Origin, Project Leader, Project Funding Source, among others (see Data Dictionary).</p>
</section>
<section id="surveillance-activity" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="surveillance-activity">Surveillance Activity</h2>
<!-- # Surveillance Activity {.unnumbered} -->
<p>A Surveillance Activity in the data model refers to a set of activities to collect data with the aim of detecting, proving freedom of disease, measure incidence or prevalence, or assessing trends of specific health hazards within specific populations, using a common methodology. For example, the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0274490">longitudinal assessment of coronavirus shedding in two <em>Eidolon helvum</em> bat roosts in Africa</a> collected a fix number of feces from two bat roosts of the same species on a monthly basis for 12 months and tested the feces for coronaviridae sp.</p>
<p>Surveillance Activities can encompass targeted surveillance, scanning surveillance, citizen science monitoring, ranger patrols, and others. <strong>Surveillance Activities include detailed metadata that describe their objectives and methods, including information on the targeted species, populations, hazards, type of Sources and Specimens, collection methods, Diagnostics, and case definitions for Diagnostics, Specimens, and Sources, among others</strong>. A Surveillance Activity can include multiple Field Visits and Locations and Source types (groups, individual animals, environmental sources, or arthropod collections). However, it is recommended that the definition of Event, what an Event represents, is unique for the Surveillance Activity and also to keep a minimum number of hazards targeted under the same Surveillance Activity. In general, a specific set of methods, strategies, and objectives should equal a specific Surveillance Activity.</p>
<p><strong>Field Visits, Locations, Events, Sources, Source Records, and Diagnostics usually belong to a single Surveillance Activity</strong>. This is the Surveillance Activity that lead to the Field Visits at different Locations to document Events, collect Sources and Specimens, perform Diagnostics for a specific hazard, and provide Diagnosis for Diagnostics, Specimens, and Sources. However, there are exceptions to this rule (See the “Complexities” section below). Furthermore, <strong>a Surveillance Activity usually includes Field Visits, Locations, Events, Sources, Source Records, and Diagnostics, but this is not always the case</strong> (See the “Complexities” section below).</p>
<p>Most of the properties of a Surveillance Activity are associated with the standard documentation of the methods use to conduct the corresponding surveillance initiative. These properties include, Start Date, End Date, Hazards and Taxa targeted, Organizations involved, the definition of Location, the definition of Event, the type of Sources included, the methods to find or establish Sources, Specimens collected and method of collection, the diagnostics used, case definitions for the diagnostic tests, the Specimens, and the Sources at time <em>t</em>, among others.</p>
</section>
<section id="outbreak-investigation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outbreak-investigation">Outbreak Investigation</h2>
<p>Each outbreak investigations are considered a Surveillance Activity. Outbreak Surveillance Activities can encompass the Field Visit that lead to the Outbreak detection and the following Field Visits associated with Outbreak investigation and control. The detection could have been made during a Field Activity conducted by rangers during their patrols. This initial Field Visit and its components should be assigned to a the ranger patrol Surveillance Activity and to the Outbreak Surveillance Activity. The following Field Activities that could be completed by veterinarians or public health officers receive the outbreak Surveillance Activity only.</p>
</section>
<section id="field-visit" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="field-visit">Field Visit</h2>
<!-- # Field Visit {.unnumbered} -->
<p>A Field Visit in the data model represents a time period, including a start and end date, to visit Locations, identify Events and Sources, collect Specimens (see below) and document data from them. A Field Visit can include various types of Locations (see below), such as markets, natural areas, rehabilitation centers, caves, etc. that are visited within the same trip and common start and end date. A Field Visit should include at least one Location up to an indefinite number of Locations (areas).</p>
<p>Properties of a Field Visit include the Start and End Date, Field Visit ID, Field Visit Code, Field Visit Cross Reference ID, Field Visit Cross Reference Origin, Leader of the Visit, among others (see Data Dictionary). If the data of interest per Field Activity includes attributes that are not part of the data model, it has to be reported as part of the Surveillance Activity metadata and it is recommended to keep track of these attributes in a different source (another database, an excel sheet, etc.). Common extra Attributes can be added to the data model in the future. Missing Options for single- and multi-selection attributes of Field Visits can be added as long as they promote a controlled vocabulary.</p>
</section>
<section id="location" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="location">Location</h2>
<!-- # Location {.unnumbered} -->
<p>A Location in the data model refers to a general area (polygon) where Events can be identified, and Source Records, Carcasses, and Specimens can be collected from. A Location serves as a way to group data in areas compared to the Events that group data under a exact latitude and longitude (‘Event’; see below). A single Location (area) can include between zero Events (e.g., a Location is explored but no Event is found) up to a indefinite number of Events (points).</p>
<p>What a ‘Location’ represents will inevitably vary depending on the Surveillance Activity methodology. For example, for the collection of arthropods, a Location can represent a parcel where traps are set. In a structured/hierarchical/clustered/nested research, the Location could represent a grid cell. In ranger patrols, the Location can correspond to either the full protected area, or a specific zone within the protected area. <strong>It is up to the user to define what unit the Location area represents and report it in the Surveillance Activity metadata</strong>.</p>
<p>Properties of Location include Location ID, Location Code, Location Cross Reference ID, Location Cross Reference Origin, Location Type, Environmental Characteristics, among others (see Data Dictionary). If the data of interest per Location includes attributes that are not part of the data model, it has to be reported as part of the Surveillance Activity metadata and it is recommended to keep track of these attributes in a different source (another database, an excel sheet, etc.). Common extra Attributes can be added to the data model in the future. Missing Options for single- and multi-selection attributes of Locations can be added as long as they promote a controlled vocabulary.</p>
</section>
<section id="event" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="event">Event</h2>
<!-- # Event {.unnumbered} -->
<p>An Event in the data model refers to a distinct wildlife health event that occurs at a specific longitude and latitude on a particular date (time stamp). A single Event (point) can include between zero Collections (e.g., opportunistic detection of Sources) up to a indefinite number of Collections.</p>
<p>The definition of a wildlife health event, and thus what an ‘Event’ represents, will inevitably vary depending on the Surveillance Activity. For example, in active surveillance efforts, an Event can refer to the site where animals are captured, starting at time <em>t</em>, to obtain Specimens, the site and time where a dead dead animal is found during a ranger patrol, the site and time where water is collected from a pond. In the case of surveillance for vector-borne diseases, an Event can represent a site where one or several traps for vectors are deployed at time X. In the case of beached fish, an Event can represent the position and time of recording of each individual dead fish in one extreme, or the total count of dead fish across the beach reported as a single point in the other extreme. In the context of a wet market, the definition of Event can be applied to the market, to vendors, to the stalls of vendors, or to the cages in the stalls at time <em>t</em>. For study A the Event could the grid cell where traps are deployed, whilst for study B it could each trap within a grid cell.</p>
<p>Moreover, the presence of at least one Source could be needed to establish an Event. For example, a dead animal found during a ranger patrol at time <em>t</em> leads to an Event. In Active Surveillance, an <strong>Event can occur might not have any Source, for example, when a capturing effort that started at time <em>t</em> ended with no animals captured</strong>. Additionally, the definition of an Event can include or not healthy animals. In the example of the dead animal found by the ranger at time <em>t</em>, it could be possible that the Event definition includes the documentation of healthy animals also or not.</p>
<p>Consequently, an Event in wildlife health surveillance can represent different entities depending on the objectives and the methodology used to collect wildlife health data. <strong>It is up to the user to define what unit the Event represents and report it in the Surveillance Activity metadata. It is recommended that each Surveillance Activity has a single definition of what an Event represents</strong>.</p>
<p>Properties of Event include the Start Date, Event ID, Event Code, Event Cross Reference ID, Event Cross Reference Origin, Longitude, Latitude, the Coordinate Reference System used, among others (see Data Dictionary). If the data of interest per Event includes attributes that are not part of the data model, it has to be reported as part of the Surveillance Activity metadata and it is recommended to keep track of these attributes in a different source (another database, an excel sheet, etc.). Common extra Attributes can be added to the data model in future versions. Missing Options for single- and multi-selection attributes of Events can be added as long as they promote a controlled vocabulary.</p>
</section>
<section id="collection" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="collection">Collection</h2>
<p>A <strong>Collection</strong> in the data model represents the effort associated with the observation, finding, capturing, etc. of Sources at the longitude and latitude of an Event that starts at the Event time stamp. For example, the number of hours an observer spent in a post to identify dead birds in a wetland and the tools used to find it (e.g., telescope, binoculars); the number of camera traps in a specific latitude and longitude to photograph a sick animal and the hours they were deployed; the distance and time traveled by a ranger to find a dead animal; the type of trap, bait, time period, and set of equivalent traps to collect mosquitoes at a specific site.</p>
<p><strong>A Collection can contain between zero Source Records (e.g., a capturing effort but no animal is captured) up to a indefinite number of Source Records</strong>. If Sources are found opportunistically, then no Collection is involved (e.g., articles from news articles where the coordinates of the site and the date reported determine the Event and the animals involved are the Source Records).</p>
<p><strong>A Collection usually contains a specific type of Source Records (either Group Source Record, Animal Source Records, Environmental Source Records, and Invertebrate Source Records)</strong> Because multiple Collections can be part of an Event, then an Event can contain Source Records of multiple types.</p>
<p><strong>Collections are defined by the type of spatial and temporal units to complete it, the number of those units, and the position of those number of units with respect to the spatio-temporal coordinates of the Event</strong>. A spatial unit can be mist nets deployed, CO2 traps deployed, camera traps deployed, kilometers walked, square kilometers scanned, etc. A temporal unit can be hours walking, days searched, minutes observed, etc. Then, each Collection has a number of the assigned unit (e.g., “6” for number and “kilometers walking” for unit). Finally, the position with respect to the Event spatio-temporal coordinates can be “at the Event”, “around the Event”, “from the beginning of the Event”, “up to the Event”, etc.</p>
<p>For example, a Collection of an Event constituted by an individual at a post in a wetland that spent 6 hours to scan for dead birds using binoculars has as spatial Attributes: “1”, “observer binocular” “at the Event”; and temporal Attributes: “6”, “hours”, “at the Event”.</p>
<p>Another example is a ranger walking for 10 kilometers since the beginning of the patrol to find a dead animal. The spatial Attributes are: “10”, “kilometers walked”, “to the Event”; and temporal Attributes are not relevant (or the time walking to get to the Event could be reported as well). A final example is two CO2 traps and a BG trap to collect mosquitoes deployed for a night. In this case, there are two Collections as <strong>a set of equivalent units constitute a single Collection per Event</strong>. The spatial Attributes of the CO2 traps are: “2”, “CO2 traps”, “at the Event”; and temporal Attributes are: “1”, “night”, “at the Event”. The spatial Attributes of the BG trap are: “1”, “BG trap”, “at the Event”; and temporal Attributes are: “1”, “night”, “at the Event”. To document the three traps separately, three Events with a single trap each must be created.</p>
<p><strong>It is not accepted to provide the spatial relationship with the Event as “meters after the Event” or the time relationship with the Event as “hours before the Event”</strong>.</p>
<p>Collections also allow to characterize problems during the search for Sources, such as camera traps running out of battery or stolen, torn mist nets, etc.</p>
<p>When Source Records are obtained without a <strong>Collection</strong> (e.g., animals sampled in a market, citizen science reports of dead animals) the property “Unit” is “none”, the “number of units” is NA, and the positioning with respect to the Event is NA.</p>
<p>Further properties of Collection include the Collection ID, Collection Code, Collection Cross Reference ID, Collection Cross Reference Origin, Problems, among others (see Data Dictionary). If the data of interest per Collection includes attributes that are not part of the data model, it has to be reported as part of the Surveillance Activity metadata and it is recommended to keep track of these attributes in a different source (another database, an excel sheet, etc.). Common extra Attributes can be added to the data model in future versions. Missing Options for single- and multi-selection attributes of Collection can be added as long as they promote a controlled vocabulary.</p>

<!-- # Source and Source Records {.unnumbered} -->
<section id="generalities" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="generalities">Generalities</h3>
<p>A Source in the data model is a unit that can be observed and provide Specimens, including carcasses, organic tissue, abiotic tissue, or arthropods. Sources can provide between zero (no sampling) up to indefinite number of Specimens. The data model manages four types of Sources: i) a co-specific group of animals (Group Source), ii) individual animals (Animal Source), iii) sites that can provide abiotic tissue of interest or biotic material of animal origin whose individual or group animal of origin is unknown (Environmental Source), and iv) sites where active or passive collection arthropods at any life stage is completed (Arthropod Source). A Group Source could correspond to a specific bat roost of species X sourcing guano, an Animal Source could be a collared animal, an Environmental Source could be a pond where water is collected from, and an Arthropod Source could be a site where mosquito larvae are collected from. Sources contain time-independent data only, such as the species of an animal in the case of a Group Source or an Animal Source (more below).</p>
<p><strong>All Sources can potentially be individually identified and followed over time if needed</strong>. Environmental and Arthropod Sources are closely associated with a specific site that is easy to track over time; however, <strong>Animal Sources and Group Sources might not be individually identified preventing following them over time</strong>.</p>
<p>A Source observed, collected, or captured at time <em>t</em> is linked to Events through Collections via a <strong>Source Record</strong> (the Source at time <em>t</em>). These Source Record Source Records contain time-dependent data only, such as health status at time <em>t</em> (Group and Animal Sources). <strong>Sources individually identified can be followed longitudinally and have multiple Source Records that link them to multiple Events over time of the same or different Surveillance Activity</strong>. For example, a bat (Source) caught in a mist net (Collection) set up at a roost (Event), identified individually, and recaptured in a following Event. This bat is linked to the capture Event and the recapture Event through a single Source Record for each Event.</p>
<p><strong>Sources that are not individually identified will belong to the Event when they were observed or captured only</strong>. For example, a bat (Source) that is captured (Collection) and sampled during an Event but not marked or a dead animal found by a ranger during a patrol. The bat and the animal found are linked only to the Event they were capture and observed, respectively.</p>
</section>
<section id="group-source" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="group-source">Group Source</h3>
<p><strong>A Group Source is a unit of co-specific individuals (animals of the same species) associated to a herd, an area, a site, a farm, a cage, a stall, an enclosure, or another that makes the individuals part a single epidemiological unit</strong>. Group Sources can be observed, captured, and provide Specimens at time <em>t</em>. Data of a Group Source include the Species, the Group Source Identifier, the Group Source Cross identifier, and the date of extinction, among others (see Data Dictionary).</p>
<p>The purpose of Group Source is to record individuals at health events at the species level instead of individual by individual. This can occur when herds are the unit of interest, when protected area rangers find animals of the same species in a health event, or animals in a unit such as a cage, stall, or vendor of a market are recorded. For example, animals of two species in a single cage. If the animals are not meant to be tracked individually, the animals of each species in the cage represent a Group Source.</p>
<section id="group-source-record" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="group-source-record">Group Source Record</h4>
<p><strong>A Group Source Record consists of a count of the animals in the Group Source at time <em>t</em>, stratified by sex, age, and health status (e.g., healthy, injured, sick, or dead)</strong>. Other properties of the Group Source Record are observed anomalies, potential causes of disease or death if they apply at time <em>t</em>, among others (see Data Dictionary). Properties of a Group Source Record are documented at the group level, therefore, each property can receive multiple options. For example, a Group Source with three dead animals can receive several potential causes of death. <strong>It is not possible to know the distribution of the potential causes of death and other properties across individuals of a Group Source Record</strong>, but only that they were present in at least one individual (the exception is the “species” property and other properties when a Group Source has a single individual).</p>
<p><strong>Group Source Records can include a mix of dead, diseased, poisoned, infected, injured, and healthy individuals of the same species or animals of the same species that belong to just one of these categories exclusively (all animals are dead for example)</strong>. A Group Source Record of only healthy animals can also be part of a Health Event depending on the definition of Event. <strong>Group Source Records can have a single individual</strong>. For example, rangers patrolling a protected area might find a dead animal of species X and two dead animals of species Y at the same site (Event) and rangers record their animal data as Group Sources. If this is the case, the single animal of species X belong to a Group Source Record and the two animals of species Y correspond to another Source Group Record. Moreover, if only a single animal of a known herd is observed at time <em>t</em>, then that individual is the representation of the herd for the Source Group Record. Finally, <strong>an Event can have more than one Group Source Record of the same species</strong>. For example, animals of the same species in two cages hold by a vendor in market where the vendor is considered an Event. Then the animals per cage could be considered a unit, and therefore, two Group Source Records of the same species under the same vendor (same Event).</p>
<p><strong>An animal of species X documented as part of a Group Source Record must not be included as an Animal Source Record and vice-versa</strong>. If an Event contains a Group Source Record of species X and an Animal Source Record of species X, then the total number of animals of species X at the Event is the sum of the number of animals of species X in the Group Source Record and the single individual of species X recorded as an Animal Source Record. An example is a herd of cows illegally raised in a protected area whose health is assessed at time <em>t</em>. The herd of this example contains 20 cows. Two of them are sampled and the rest are part of a single unit. In this case, the sampled cows can be added as two Animal Source Records (one per sampled cow) and the remaining 18 animals can be added as a single Group Source Record that distributes the animals per sex, age, and health status. The total number of cows are the individuals in the Group Source Record (18) and the two cows recorded as Animal Records. The “herd” identity of the 20 cows can be kept using a cluster (see “Complexities”). If the Group Source Record contains the original 20 cows and also two Animal Source Records, then the total number of cows will be 22.</p>

<section id="animal-source" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="animal-source">Animal Source</h3>
<p><strong>An Animal Source represents an individual animal whose specific individual-level data is of interest</strong>. Animal Sources can be observed, captured, tested, and provide Specimens at time <em>t</em>, including the full carcass to have a Necropsy completed. Animal Source data includes the Species, the Identifier, the Cross Identifier, the Sex, among others (see Data Dictionary). Past marking codes (if any have been used) are considered immutable and entered as data of the Animal Source.</p>
<p>An example of Animal Sources are animals of different or the same species in a cage located in a live market. If the data of the animals is to be collected at the individual-level, then each individual represents an Animal Group Source in the cage.</p>
<section id="animal-source-record" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="animal-source-record">Animal Source Record</h4>
<p><strong>An Animal Source Record consists of an Animal Source at time <em>t</em> </strong>. Properties of an Animal Source Record are its Age, Health Status, Observed Anomalies, and Potential Cause of Disease or Death if they apply at time <em>t</em>, among others (see Data Dictionary). The current marking code of an individual animal at time <em>t</em> is considered mutable and a property of the corresponding Animal Source Record. Properties of an Animal Source Record can receive single or multiple choices. For example, the observed health status in only one (live healthy, live sick) but an Animal Source Record can receive several observed anomalies if they apply at time <em>t</em> (wounded, hair loss, diarrhea, etc. See Data Dictionary).</p>
<p>An Animal Source can be either dead, diseased, poisoned, infected, injured, or healthy at time <em>t</em>. <strong>An Animal Source Record with an observed health status “live healthy” can be part of an Event depending on he Event definition</strong> (e.g., a healthy animal of species X next to dead animals of species X, Y, and Z; healthy animals captured for Specimen collection).</p>
<p>An Animal Source can be used directly for a Diagnostic (e.g., X-rays in a live animal). The data model can accommodate Diagnostics applied to the “animal” itself rather than a Specimen taken from that Animal Source.</p>
<p><strong>An animal of species X documented as part of a Group Source Record cannot be included as an Animal Source Record and vice versa</strong>. If an Event contains a Group Source Record and an Animal Source Record of species X, then the total number of animals of species X at the Event is the sum of number of animals of species X in the Group Source Record and the single individual of species X recorded as an Animal Source Record. An example is a herd of cows illegally raised in a protected area whose health is assessed at time <em>t</em>. The herd of this example contains 20 cows. Two of them are sampled and the rest are part of a single unit. In this case, the sampled cows can be added as Animal Source Records (one per sampled cow) and the remaining 18 animals can be added as a single Group Source Record that distributes the animals per sex, age, and health status. The total number of cows are the individuals in the Group Source Record (18) and the two cows recorded as Animal Records (2). The “herd” identity of the 20 cows can be kept using a “Tag” (see below) so the three Source Records receive the same unit (another option is to add the 20 cows as a Group Source but the data of the specific animals sampled will be lost. See next section). If the Group Source Record contains the original 20 cows and also two Animal Source Records, then the total number of cows will be 22.</p>

<section id="carcass" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="carcass">Carcass</h4>
<p>The carcass of a dead Animal Source can be used as a source for Specimens and Diagnosis. A Carcass entered to the database comes from a specific Animal Source and they are collected at a single specific time <em>t</em>. Therefore, each Carcass is associated with one and only one Animal Source Record (when the Carcass was collected). Properties of a Carcass include its decomposition condition, storage during transport, storage in a facility, and its location (building, room, refrigerator, etc.), among others (see Data Dictionary). The data regarding changes in the storage of the carcass can have many units for the same carcass if it changes over time.</p>
<p>An carcass can be used directly for a Diagnostic (e.g., X-rays in a dead animal). The data model can accommodate Diagnostics applied to the Carcass itself rather than a Specimen taken from that Carcass (see Diagnostics). The diagnostic information is part of the set of Diagnostics conducted in the corresponding Animal Source.</p>
<section id="necropsy" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="necropsy">Necropsy</h5>
<p>A Necropsy is associated with a specific Animal Source Record that can occur any date after the corresponding Animal is found dead. However, <strong>a Necropsy is tied to the Carcass</strong>, which is tied to the Animal Source Record when it was collected. <strong>The earliest date a Necropsy can occur is when the dead animal was found and a Field Necropsy was conducted (no Carcass collection) or when the Carcass was collected and used for Necropsy</strong>. Necropsy data includes the identifier, the cross identifier, the date of the necropsy, findings per system, among others (see Data Dictionary).</p>
<p>Necropsies can be primary or secondary. A primary necropsy usually starts with an intact carcass (not previously used in a necropsy). A secondary necropsy is usually conducted by a veterinarian pathologist using pictures of the primary necropsy or using a carcass already necropsied.</p>

<p><strong>An Environmental Source is a unit in space where Specimens that cannot be associated with a Group Source, an Animal Source, or Arthropod Source can be collected from</strong> (e.g., feces found in the field but unknown individual dropping them or unknown group of animals with the individual that could have dropped them). Properties of an Environmental Source include the type (e.g., water, soil, sediment, air , feces), the species (only for biotic types if it is known), the identifier, and the cross identifier (see Data Dictionary). The species can be either NA (abiotic type such as water, sediment, or soil), “unknown” (e.g., “unknown” for feces found by themselves), or the most accurate taxonomy level that can be given to a biotic Environmental Source if barcoding or another species determination method is not used (e.g., “mammalia” for feces found by themselves).</p>
<section id="environmental-source-record" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="environmental-source-record">Environmental Source Record</h4>
<p><strong>An Environmental Source Record is the collected biotic or abiotic tissue from the Environmental Source at time <em>t</em> using the same method</strong>. For example, the water obtained from a pond at time <em>t</em> across devices targeting water collection. This mean that air collected by any number of devices “X” deployed at the Environmental Source at time <em>t</em> to collect air is an Environmental Source Record and air collected by any number of devices “Y” deployed at the Environmental Source at time <em>t</em> to collect air is another Environmental Source Record. <strong>A key difference between the Environmental Source and the Group and Animal Sources is that an Event can contain multiple Environmental Source Records of the same Environmental Source (one per collection method) compared with Group and Animal Sources Records types that only have a single Source Record per Source per Event</strong>. The properties of an Environmental Source Record include the identifier, the cross identifier, the volume collected, the unit of the volume collected, among others (see Data Dictionary).</p>

<p><strong>An Arthropod Source is a unit in space where collection of arthropods can be completed</strong> (e.g., a household in the forest where traps are set). Properties of an Arthropod Source include the identifier, the cross identifier, the area covered, among others (see Data Dictionary).</p>
<p><strong>If the interest of the Surveillance Activity is at the arthropod individual level (e.g., butterflies with problems in their wings or with parasites), then the user should consider these arthropods as Animal Sources. Arthropods from Animals Sources (attached ticks, lice, fleas, mites) are Specimens from an Animal Source and not Arthropod Sources</strong>.</p>
<section id="arthropod-source-record" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="arthropod-source-record">Arthropod Source Record</h4>
<p><strong>An Arthropod Source Record is the collected arthropods from the Arthropod Source at time <em>t</em> using the same method</strong>. For example, the number of mosquitoes obtained at the household in the forest at time <em>t</em> per species and age-sex-condition across the traps targeting the same group of arthropods. This mean that adult mosquitoes of <em>n</em> species collected by any number of CO2 traps deployed at the Arthropod Source at time <em>t</em> is an Arthropod Source Record and that adult mosquitoes of <em>n</em> species collected by any number of BG traps deployed at the Arthropod Source at time <em>t</em> is another Arthropod Source Record. <strong>A key difference between the Arthropod Source and the Group and Animal Sources is that an Event can contain multiple Arthropod Source Records of the same Arthropod Source (one per collection method) compared with Group and Animal Sources Records types that only have a single Source Record per Source per Event</strong>. The properties of an Arthropod Source Record include the identifier, the cross identifier, the species, the age, sex, condition of the females, the corresponding number, among others (see Data Dictionary).</p>
<p>Group and Animal Source Records can be clustered in nested or non-nested spatial units contained within an Event if needed (e.g., Source records within a stall (spatial cluster) of a vendor (Event) of a market (Location). Environmental and Arthropod Sources Records cannot be clustered in a unit smaller than Event, as they already represent a minimal spatio-temporal unit (a specific time at a specific point) that are grouped by Collection.</p>

<p>Specimens are tissue or material collected from Sources, other Specimens, and Diagnostic products (See Diagnostics) to conduct Diagnostics and identify hazards or other potential health threats. <strong>Specimens can originate from Sources at time <em>t</em>, but also from other Specimens, or Diagnostic Products</strong>.</p>
<p>In the data model, a single Specimen can be composed of feces of a specific animal collected in the field mixed with water from a pond next to that Animal. Therefore, <strong>Specimens can be created using tissue collected from many Sources of different types</strong>.</p>
<p>In the data model, a new Specimen can be created by mixing Specimens of any origin and Diagnostic Products. Therefore, <strong>Specimens can originate by mixing Specimens, or by mixing Diagnostic Products, or by mixing Specimens and Diagnostic Products. These are “Pooled Specimens”</strong>.</p>
<p>Specimens are characterized by an identifier, the type of material (water, hair, kidney, animal), the original amount collected (e.g., ‘full animal’ or 0.35 mm), the current amount, their origin (Source Record, other Specimen, or Diagnostic Product), among others. Additionally, the data model can hold data on the storage location of Specimens (building, laboratory name, refrigerator name, etc.), their availability, ownership, current amount, and exportation processes (See Data Dictionary).</p>
<p>Specimens without any amount of tissue left can be kept in the data model so the last storage, exportation processes, and its use in Diagnostic procedures can be tracked.</p>
</section>
<section id="specimens-from-source-records" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="specimens-from-source-records">Specimens from Source Records</h4>
<p>Specimens can be tissue collected from Sources at time <strong>t</strong> (from Source Records). These Specimens can range from the entire body of a living animal to conduct an ultrasound to a minimal amount of fluid (e.g., blood) to perform advanced assays. An example of Group Source Specimen is feces collected from the bottom of a cage with animals of the same species but it is unknown which of the animals dropped the feces. An example of Animal Source Specimen is 2 ml of blood taken from a lion. An example of Environmental Source Specimen is 10 grams of soil collected from a specific site. An example of Arthropod Source Specimen is a set mosquitoes of the same species coming from the same trap type collection. In vector-borne disease surveillance, this last type of Specimen are usually called “pools”.</p>
<p>The data model does not accommodate Specimens that were collected after the last date a Source was observed. For example, it is possible to collect feces from an empty cage that a Group Source providing feces longitudinally was using until two days ago. In this case, the Specimen origin changes from the Group Source followed longitudinally to an Environmental Source (the cage). Using a clustering variable, it is possible to track that the Specimens are coming from the same cage, in one case with animals and in the last one without animals (clustering the Sources coming from the same cage).</p>
<p><strong>An Group Source used directly for a Diagnostic (e.g., assessment of fat in carcasses of animals belonging to a specific herd) is not a Specimen</strong>.</p>
<p>In the case of Animal Sources, new Specimens can be generated during a Necropsy (e.g., Specimens from the Carcass). In this case, the date of Specimen collection is not necessarily the date when the Animal Source was found, when the Carcass was collected, or when the animal died, but the date of the Necropsy (primary or secondary). It is possible to track if a Specimen was collected during the primary or secondary Necropsy based on the information entered for Specimens. <strong>An Animal Source used directly for a Diagnostic (e.g., X-rays in a live animal) is not a Specimen</strong></p>
<p>In the case of Environmental Sources, its type determines the Specimen type. For example, a pond of water can only yield Specimens of type “water”.</p>

<p>Products generated by Diagnostic methods applied to a regular Specimen can be stored and used as Specimen in further Diagnostics (e.g., use cDNA created to complete Diagnostic A in a new RT-PCR Diagnostic B). The data model can accommodate Diagnostic Products to be use in future Diagnostics. In this case, the origin of these new “Specimens” is a specific Diagnostic and not a Source Record,m and its type is “Diagnostic Product”.

<p>Specimens can be created by mixing other Specimens of any origin. For example, mixing a Specimen from a Diagnostic Product, a Specimen from an Arthropod Source, a Specimen from an Animal Source, and a Specimen from an Environmental Source. The origin of Pooled Specimens is tracked in the data model. In the example, the origin will be associated with four Specimens. The remaining properties are the same (see Data Dictionary).</p>

<p>In situations where space or materials are limited, it is possible that multiple Specimens are stored in a unique container. This approach is clearly not ideal because it can lead to cross-contamination and make actual Specimen tracing more complex. To address the tracing of these Specimens, a unique container identifier, such as a jar identifier, can be provided to the Specimen (see Data Dictionary). Specific properties for each individual Specimen within the container, such as type, quantity, etc, should allow their visual identification within the container.</p>

</section>
<section id="diagnostics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="diagnostics">Diagnostics</h2>
<p>Diagnostics in the data model encompass various techniques used to identify hazards (biological, chemical, physical) or physiological problems in either Source Records of Animal and Group Sources or Specimens obtained from Source Records. Each Diagnostic is designed for a specific targeted hazard, such as a viral family or a particular virus species. Diagnostics include three main components: type, method, and result.</p>
<p>The type of Diagnostic refers to a general category of diagnostic techniques, such as histopathology, serology, or imaging. Within each type, there are specific methods available, such as biopsy, ELISA assays, X-rays, or the width of fat in a herd. These methods can be applied at different levels, such as organs, serum, specific body areas to an entire Animal Source, or carcasses from a Group Source, respectively.</p>
<p>In the data model, <strong>each Diagnostic has a unit of measurement that can either be qualitative or quantitative. The result of the diagnostic is reported as a value of those units. The interpretation, based on the result on those units, can either be positive, negative, or undetermined</strong>. <strong>It is ideal to include supporting information to each Diagnostic, such as digital images or files to corroborate the entered result in the database</strong>.</p>
<p>The Interpretation of a Diagnostic <strong>should adhere to the case definition criteria established in the corresponding Surveillance Activity metadata for each declared method</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnostics can produce “Diagnostic Products” that are treated as a Specimen</strong> in the data model for two main reasons. The first one is the possibility to track the location of the product, the quantities available, and any exportation process. The second reason is because these Diagnostics Products can be used in further Diagnostics. For example, the cDNA from a RT-PCR assay that is used as material for a new chain reaction.</p>
<p>Properties of a Diagnostic include the Diagnostic ID, Diagnostic Code, Diagnostic Cross Reference ID, Diagnostic Cross Reference Origin, the Laboratory conducting the Diagnostic, the targeted hazards, Measurement Unit, the Result, the Interpretation, among others (see Data Dictionary).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="complexities-1">Complexities</h2>
<p>For example, rodents trapped in the same Event may be sampled using the same methodology but tested for coronaviruses and Rickettsia <em>sp</em>. In this scenario, two Surveillance Activities should be assigned to the Field Visits, Locations, Events, Source Records, and Specimens. Diagnostics for either group of pathogens and the corresponding Diagnosis should only get a single Surveillance Activity.</p>
<p>Another exception to this rule is the collection of Specimens from Sources that belonged to other Surveillance Activities. For example, marked rodents that were released, and later captured and tested for a specific hazard under Surveillance Activity A that were captured and sampled during Surveillance Activity B months later. In this case, these rodents will be part of two Surveillance Activities (A and B).</p>
<p>Another exception occurs when Specimens were collected during past surveillance efforts but are included in new surveillance initiatives. For instance, using pangolin Specimens collected by veterinarians in 2017 and tested for Salmonella sps. which are then tested in 2023 for SARS-CoV-2. In this case, the latter Surveillance Activity is assigned to the Specimens being tested (as a second Surveillance Activity) and to the SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostics and Diagnosis. Therefore, these Specimens should have two Surveillance Objectives. The first one corresponds to the original Surveillance Activity that lead to their collection and the second one corresponds to the Surveillance Activity testing them for SARS-CoV-2. The Source (pangolin) and the corresponding Record should keep a single Surveillance Activity.</p>
<p>Moreover, Necropsies might be conducted as part of a secondary Surveillance Activity (on a Carcass that was collected under other Surveillance Activity) or new Specimens could be created from a previously unused Carcass as part of a new Surveillance Activity. In this case, the new data (Necropsy and Specimens) should receive the second Surveillance Activity only. Diagnostics using the new Specimens should receive the second Surveillance Activity only. The Carcass should receive the Surveillance Activity that lead to its collection only.</p>
<p>Finally, the health of the same animal could be assessed under different Surveillance Activities. For example, a ranger that finds a sick animal in a specific date and assess it health and potential cause of disease. Then, the animal is taken to a rehabilitation center where its health is assessed again at admission and samples are collected for testing. Finally, the animal health at the rehabilitation center can be assessed again later and more sampled could be taken in order to learn what pathogens are circulating within the facility. This animal has been part of three potential Surveillance Activities, each with different target populations and methods. To track the path of this animal, each Field Visit (ranger patrolling, the admission at the rehabilitation center, and the sampling at admission) should be part of one Surveillance Activity only. The Locations within each Field Activity (a protected area, the rehabilitation center, and the rehabilitation center), should be part of the first, the second, and third Surveillance Activities only. Each Event at each Location, (when it was found originally in the protected area, examined at admission to the rehabilitation center, and then sampled after admission) should be part of a single Surveillance Activity,</p>
<p>it should receive the three Surveillance Activities. Each Event (when it was found originally, examined at admission to the rehabilitation center, and then sampled after admission) should be part of a single Surveillance Activity, the Locations (a protected area and the rehabilitation center), should be part of one and two Surveillance Activities, respectively correspondingly,</p>
<p>Therefore, Surveillance Activities can be interconnected through the reuse of Specimens or expanding the data generated by previous Surveillance Activities. These connections will be evident in the exported data, where each component with multiple Surveillance Activities (e.g., Specimen) will be represented by one row per Surveillance Activity.</p>
<p>Locations can be clustered in larger nested or non-nested spatial units if needed. For a detail explanation, see “Clustering of Locations, Events, and Source Records” section below.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="clustering-of-locations-events-and-source-records">Clustering of Locations, Events, and Source Records</h2>
<!-- # Grouping of Locations, Events, and Sources {.unnumbered} -->
<p>The simplest data of a Field Visit is a single Location with a single Event where a single Source Record is collected. However, depending on the methodology of a specific Surveillance Activity, Source Records could be clustered in units that are clustered by Events. In the same manner, Events can be clustered by units that are clustered by Locations, and Locations can be clustered by units that are clustered by Field Visits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Field Activity<sub>w</sub>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cluster unit</strong><sub>𝛼</sub>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cluster unit</strong><sub>𝛽</sub>
<ul>
<li>Location<sub>x</sub>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cluster unit</strong><sub>γ</sub>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cluster unit</strong><sub>𝛿</sub>
<ul>
<li>Event<sub>y</sub>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cluster unit</strong><sub>𝜂</sub>
<ul>
<li>Source Record<sub>z</sub></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>A second layer of complexity is the addition of clustered units that are not nested. For example, the same structure shown before plus the cluster of Source Records per season of the year (Temporal Cluster unit):</p>
<ul>
<li>Field Activity<sub>w</sub>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spatial Cluster unit</strong><sub>𝛼</sub>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spatial Cluster unit</strong><sub>𝛽</sub>
<ul>
<li>Location<sub>x</sub>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spatial Cluster unit</strong><sub>γ</sub>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spatial Cluster unit</strong><sub>𝛿</sub>
<ul>
<li>Event<sub>y</sub>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spatial Cluster unit</strong><sub>𝜂</sub></li>
<li><strong>Temporal Cluster unit</strong><sub>д</sub>
<ul>
<li>Source Record<sub>z</sub></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the units Location, Event, and Source Record could be enough to record the data structure of a specific Surveillance Activity gathering information during patrols (Field Visits) in Protected Areas (Locations) at points (Events) where dead animals (Source Records) are found at any given time. However, another Surveillance Activity could have the following structure: patrol (Field Visit), protected area (cluster level 1), zones within protected area (Location), grid cells within each zone (cluster level 2), capture site (Event) with a pair of mist nests within each grid cell, mist nets of the capture site (cluster level 3), and bats captured (Source Records) per season (temporal cluster 1).</p>
<!-- Further characteristics of each clustering unit, whether static or time dependent through the Surveillance Activity period, should be prepared in a file, such as an excel sheet, with columns with the identifiers of all relevant units (Location grouping units. Event grouping units that are not the Location, and Source Record grouping units that are not the Event) and  attached it at the corresponding level. A recommendation is to prepared a sheet for the features of all spatio temporal grouping units visited during a Field Visit and attach it at this level (Field Visit). The columns with the identifiers will allow joining the data of the corresponding Field Visit (Locations, Events, Source Records, grouping units) with the attached and spatial data. -->
<p>In another example, a Surveillance Activity involved sampling animals and cages in a market. One of the potential options to structure these data is to set the market as the Location and set each vendor within the market as an Event. Animals are in cages and cages are clustered in stalls. In one of the Events (a vendor), a sample of feces is collected from the bottom of a cage, the cage has three animals of the same species X, and only one of these three animals is sampled (Animal Source). In this scenario, the Sources (a Group Source Record with two animals of species X and a Animal Source Record of species X also), are clustered by cage (clustering unit 1), by stall (clustering group 2), Event (vendor), Location (market), and Field Activity.</p>
<p>To accommodate these structures, the data model allows the inclusion of clustering levels between the Source Record and Event, Event and Location, and Location and Field Visit. The data model also allows the inclusion of non-nested clustering units. Unavoidably, the number of clustering levels, what each of these clustering units represent, what they are clustering, and the data to be collected from each of these extra units will vary among Surveillance Activities. Therefore, clustering units properties and what their represent must be reported in the Surveillance Activity metadata. The only default properties for each unit are the identifier, the cross identifier, the origin of the cross identifier, and a description. Other potential properties must be documented in a separate file (e.g., an excel sheet) with common identifiers to allow joining the clusters with the corresponding data.</p>
