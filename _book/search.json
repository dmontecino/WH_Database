    "text": "WildlifeHealthDat is a flexible database built to track wildlife health data collected from a wide range of surveillance efforts, including citizen observations of dead, injured or sick animals, specific research, national or local wildlife health surveillance initiatives, outbreak investigations, and global wildlife health surveillance projects involving several countries, hazards, and host species.\nThe database is based on the decades-long experience of the Wildlife Conservation Society - Health Program. This experience includes wildlife health surveillance activities covering dozens of countries; cross-sectional and longitudinal studies; the establishment of wildlife health surveillance networks; many biological, chemical, and physical hazards; studying dangerous zoonotic pathogens, such as Ebola virus disease and SARS-CoV-2; emerging vector-borne pathogens such as West Nile virus; the inclusion of rangers in protected areas and surrounding communities as eyes-on-the-ground for health surveillance; the logistics needed and challenges faced to properly manage, store, and track specimens collected in the field; necropsies; different kinds of diagnostic tests; and previous experiences managing wildlife health data using different Information Managament Systems.\nThe wildlife health information is stored in the database following structured components ranging from Surveillance Objective up to Specimens and Diagnostic tests. The hierarchical structure of the databse components is: i) Projects &gt;&gt; Surveillance Objectives &gt;&gt; Field Activities &gt;&gt; Locations &gt;&gt; Incidents &gt;&gt; Sources &gt;&gt; Records &gt;&gt; Specimens &gt;&gt; Diagnostics. There are four types of Sources; however, the database is modular, adjusting and selecting those components needed specifically for each surveillance initiatives. Each one of these components is explained in the next chapters."

    "section": "3.1 SURVEILLANCE OBJECTIVE",
    "text": "3.1 SURVEILLANCE OBJECTIVE\nIt is a set of activities established to collect data in order to detect, quantify, or assess trends regarding specific health hazards in specific populations under a common methodology. Each Surveillance Objective should have a specific population and hazard target, Source or Specimen Collection methods, and Diagnostics. For example, a capture-mark-recapture study targeting lead accumulation in a specific population of vultures that involves blood collection and testing at every capture using the same diagnostic technique. Surveillance Objective is the most complicated component of the database. Read this section carefully.\nSurveillance Objectives contain very specific metadata, describing their goals and methods used, including targeted species, populations, and hazards; the type of Sources and Specimens included; collection methods; and case definitions for specific Diagnostics, Specimens, and Sources. Some pieces of the metadata are provided by Source type (Observation, Animal Source, Environmental Source, and Invertebrate Source, [see below]).\nSurveillance Objectives apply for targeted surveillance and scanning surveillance initiatives so both types can be described through the metadata. All Outbreak Investigations are a Surveillance Objective, although the outbreak information (name and diagnosis) can be provided later and not immediately after the Surveillance Objective creation in the database.\nUsually, Field Activities, Locations, Incidents, Sources, Records, and Diagnostics belong to a single Surveillance Objective. This Surveillance Objective is the one that originally requested the Field Activity at different Locations to record the corresponding Incidents, collect the Sources and Specimens, and perform Diagnostics for a specific hazard. In this case, the Surveillance Objective is provided automatically to each corresponding component.\nHowever, there are exceptions to this rule, except for Diagnostics, and the exceptions have different justifications for each component. Field Activities, Locations, Incidents, Source Records, and Specimens can be originally requested by different Surveillance Objectives planning the same activities and methods but that differ in the targeted hazard. For example, rodents sampled using the same methodology that will be tested for Coronaviruses and Rickettsia sp. It is the user responsibility to add the second Surveillance Objective to the corresponding Field Activities, Locations, Incidents, Source Records, and Specimens.\nAnother exception can occur when Source Records and Specimens collected under scanning surveillance efforts are included in future targeted surveillance initiatives. For example, using pangolin Specimens collected by rangers patrolling a protected area in 2017 under a scanning surveillance strategy that are tested in 2023 for SARS-CoV-2 as part of a targeted surveillance initiative. In this case, the corresponding Specimens tested for SARS-CoV-2 and their Sources will have more than one Surveillance Objective. The one that originally demanded conducting the Field Activity to collect the Source Record and Specimens, and the new Surveillance Objective targeting SARS-CoV-2. This last Surveillance Objective DOES NOT generate new Field Activities, Locations, or Incidents. Finally, each Diagnostic remains having a single Surveillance Objective (new Diagnostics targeting SARS-CoV-2 receive the SARS-CoV-2-related Surveillance Objective only).\nMoreover, during Surveillance Objective targeting SARS-CoV-2 new Necropsies might be conducted, new Specimens could be created (from larger stored Specimens, such as a carcass or an organ), or new Pooled Specimens could be produced. All these components receive the Surveillance Objective targeting SARS-CoV-2 only. Again, it is the user responsibility secondary Surveillance Objective to the corresponding Source Records, Specimens and Diagnostics.\nTherefore, a Surveillance Objective can be linked to others because they belong to the same Project; they requested the same Field Activities, Locations, and Incidents; or they have Sources and Specimens in common. If Surveillance Objectives are connected for the second and third reason, then this connection must be provided in the metadata of the corresponding Surveillance Objectives. The connections will be also evident in the exported data such that each component with more than one Surveillance Objective (Field Activity,…, Specimens) will be represented by one row per Surveillance Objective."

More detail about what an Incident represents is provided in the next section."

    "section": "4.2 INCIDENTS",
    "text": "4.2 INCIDENTS\nAn Incident is a specific wildlife health event at specific longitude and latitude and that occurs in a specific date.\nThe definition of what a wildlife health event (and therefore of the ‘Incident’ component) depends on the Surveillance Objective methodology. In targeted surveillance efforts, an Incident could imply just healthy animals sampled in a specific time-space unit to test them for the targeted hazard. Non-sampled individuals, injured, sick, or dead may or may not be included as part of the Incident. If samples are collected from a river, then the ‘Incident’ can be equivalent to the location where water is extracted at. For the surveillance of vector-borne diseases, an ‘Incident’ could be a point in time and space where one to several traps for vectors have been placed. For scanning surveillance, an ‘Incident’ could require the presence of at least one injured, sick, or dead animal, or an stranded individual. The ‘Incident’ can also include the healthy individuals found nearby.\nIn the case of beached fish, an Incident could represent each dead fish in one extreme. On the other extreme an Incident can represent to the full count of dead fish across the beach as a single point in time and space. None of these strategies seem ideal. The former, for logistic purposes and the latter, for the loss of valuable information (distribution of the dead fish across the beach). So an Incident should represent a unit in between.\nSimilarly, an entire market could represent a ‘Location’ and a single ‘Incident’ at the same time. This Incident can gather data from several vendors, cages, and animals within cages. On the other hand, a market could be a ‘Location’ and each vendor within the market could be an ‘Incident’. Finally, a structured study can involve several levels of hierarchy and one of them receives the temporo-spatial coordinate. Another similar structured study (zone, grid, area, trap, etc.) might provide the spatial coordinate to a different unit (for example the area in one case and the trap in another case). Therefore, an Incident can represent a wide range of units depending on the methodology used to record health ata. For this reason, it is necessary to provide flexibility to what an Incident is per surveillance design and it is also necessary to request and explicitly declare what an Incident represents as part of its data.\nIn the market example or structured studies, it could be desired to group Incidents more specifically than under the general ‘Location’. For example, a market can be a ‘Location’ and each cage could represent an ‘Incident’. It is possible that users want to group cages by vendors and vendors by area within the market, Similarly, it is possible that in a structured study the ‘Incident’ represents a trap, and the researchers want to group traps these Incidents by area, grid cell, zone, and season. For this reason, the database contains several ‘Incident’ tags to group them temporally, spatially, or both in a finer scale than Location. Specific tags can be requested by users.\nIncidents must have at least one Source Record from one Source type (see below) and as many Source Records of any type as needed (depending on what is found/recorded in each specific Incident and what is the interest of the corresponding Surveillance Objective)."

    "section": "4.3 SOURCES AND SOURCE RECORDS",
    "text": "4.3 SOURCES AND SOURCE RECORDS\nA Source is an entity of interest within each Incident from which health information is collected or generated. There are four classes of Sources with different properties: Observations, Animal Source, Environmental Source, and Invertebrate Source (see below for a full description of each type). Following the modular properties of the database, the Source types become available depending on the Surveillance Objective methods and goals per user request.\nEach Source contains at least one Source Record (Source recorded at time t). Depending on the type, a Source can be recorded multiple times (several Source Records). For example, a capture-mark-recapture study with animals bled and tested at each capture instance. Obviously, the first time a Source is entered in the database corresponds to its first Source Record.\nA Source has immutable information over time. A Source Record has information of a specific Source that is mutable over time. Most Sources can provide Specimens such as full carcasses, body parts, fluids, tumors, blood, water, sediment, invertebrates, etc. These Specimens can be obtained during any of the Source Records of the corresponding Source.\nObservations provide only a single Source Record (see below). Animal Sources, Environmental Sources, and Invertebrate Sources can provide as many Source Records as needed.\n\n4.3.1 Observation\nAn Observation corresponds to observed-only animal(s) present at one Incident grouped by species. For example, a wildlife health event involving a single isolated injured animal. If this individual is observed only, then the Incident has a single Observation representing a single species. The animal count for that single species is one.\nAnother example: five animals are found in a wetland, two of them of species “A” and three of them of species “B”. One animal of species “A” is sick. If they are only observed and the Surveillance Objective is not interested in individual animal-level data,then this set of findings is a wildlife health ‘Incident’ with two ‘Observations’. One ‘Observation’ represents species “A” (one healthy individual and one sick animal), and another ‘Observation’ represents species “B” (three healthy individuals).\nIncidents can include Observations (species) with healthy animals only, as long as they are part of a wildlife health event.\nEach Observation generates one and only one Source Record with immutable data. In that unique Source Record animals are categorized by sex, age and health status. The captivity categories of the corresponding animals; their anomalies; and potential causes of injury, disease, or dead can be provided.\nIf the same set of only-observed animals are believed to be found five days latter, then a new Observation must be created because there is not certainty that they are the same individuals. If users want to track the animals longitudinally, they should be added singly to the database as ‘Animal Source’ (see below).\n\n\n4.3.2 Animal Source\nAn Animal Source represents an individual animal. Animal Sources can be added because the Surveillance Objective aims to collect individual-level health information (e.g., individual findings in stranded pilot whales), because the Animal Sources provide Specimens to perform Diagnostics or to be stored (carcass, body part, tissue, organs, samples, etc), or because a Diagnostic is conducted in individual animals that do not necessarily provide Specimens (e.g., evident hair loss in a free-ranging red fox).\nImmutable data of Animal Sources are the sex, the species, and the date of death. Previous marking codes (if any has been used) are immutable; however, current marking codes are considered mutable and are provided in the corresponding Animal Source Record (see below).\n\n4.3.2.0.1 Animal Source Record\nEach Animal Source has at least one Source Record. This first Source Record corresponds to the unique record of an unidentified individual animal or to the first record of an individually identified animal. Individually identified animals can potentially be tracked over time and have as many Source Records as needed.\nMutable data of an Animal Source over time needs to be provided for each Source Record. Mutable data includes the captivity category, the health status, the age, and the marking code. These are one option features per Animal Source Record. Other mutable data for Animal Sources that can have multiple values in each Animal Source record are the anomalies found and the potential causes of injury, disease, or death. Obviously, the time t when the Animal Source is recorded is also mutable.\nThe last Animal Source Record for an animal is not necessarily the last time t when it was found dead because it is possible to collect Specimens from the carcass (dead Animal Source) over a period of time while the carcass is rooting.\n\n\n4.3.2.0.2 Necropsies\nNecropsies are associated with the specific Animal Source Record when the carcass was collected. However, the Necropsy date can be any date since the corresponding Animal Source Record creation.\nNecropsies can be primary or secondary. Primary necropsies usually start with an intact carcass (not previously used in a necropsy). Secondary necropsies are usually conducted by a veterinarian pathologist using pictures of the primary necropsy or using a carcass already necropsied.\nNew Specimens can be generated during a Necropsy (e.g., samples from organs). In this case the date of Specimen collection is not the date of the Animal Source Record when the carcass was collected, but the date of the Necropsy (primary or secondary). It is possible to track if a Specimen was collected during the primary or secondary Necropsy based on the information collected in Specimens (see below).\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Environmental Sources\nAn Environmental Source represents an entity that provides Specimens that: i) are abiotic (e.g., a location of a frozen pond that is sampled for Avian influenza), or ii) are biotic but it is not possible to identify the corresponding Animal Source (e.g., feces found in the field). Environmental Sources do not have sex or date of death.\nImmutable data of Environmental Sources are the species (in the case of type of biotic Environmental Sources) and the Environmental Source type. Setting the Environmental Source type determines the Specimen type provided for those Sources (see ‘Specimens’ below). For example, feces can only yield feces as Specimens, and water in a pond can only provide water.\n\n4.3.3.0.1 Environmental Source Record\nEach Environmental Source has at least one Source Record. This first Source Record corresponds to the unique collection from an unidentified Environmental Source (e.g., feces on the ground) or to the first record of an individually identified Environmental Source (e.g., water collected at a specific place in the pond). Individually Environmental Sources can potentially be tracked over time and have as many Source Records as needed.\nEnvironmental Sources do not have mutable data except the time t when they are sampled.\n\n\n\n4.3.4 Invertebrate Sources\nAn Invertebrate Source is an invertebrate trap (e.g., CO2 traps, flag traps, etc.) placed in specific coordinates Invertebrate Sources can be added because the Surveillance Objective aims to collect invertebrates and potentially test them for vector-borne diseases.\nThe only immutable data of Invertebrate Sources is the trap. If the same type of trap is placed in the same coordinates, then Invertebrate Sources can be tracked longitudinally; however, the invertebrate species collected each time the trap is set can be different. Invertebrate Sources do not have sex, age, captivity category, anomalies, health status, potential cause of death, etc.\nInvertebrate Sources are designed to contain data of a collection of invertebrates. If the interest is at the individual level (e.g., bees with problems in their wings), then the user should add Animal Sources.\n\n4.3.4.0.1 Invertebrate Source Record\nEach Invertebrate Source has at least one Source Record. This first Source Record corresponds to setting the type of trap in specific coordinates. As mentioned in the previous section, if the same type of invertebrate trap is placed in the same coordinates, then Invertebrate Sources can be tracked over time and have as many Source Records as needed. If the type of trap changes, then it is a different Invertebrate Source.\nMutable data of an Invertebrate Sources needs to be provided for each Source Record. The mutable data of Invertebrate Sources is the species captured (probably more than one). Obviously, the time t when the Invertebrate Source is recorded is also mutable."

    "text": "4.4 FINAL COMMENT ON SOURCES AND SOURCE RECORDS\nUsers can group Source Records from different Sources beyond the Incident they belong to. For example, a Surveillance Objective design involves sampling animals and cages in a market as part of targeted surveillance efforts. One of the potential options to structure these data is to set the market as the Location and set each vendor within the market as an ‘Incident’. Let’s pretend that in one of the Incidents (a vendor) a sample of feces is collected from the bottom of a cage, the cage has three animals of the same species, and only one of those animals is sampled (one oral swab sample).\nUnder this scenario, the cage is providing three Source Records. Firstly, an Environmental Source with a single Environmental Source Record containing the feces sampled from the bottom of the cage. Secondly, an Observation with the two animals in the cage that are only observed (Observations always have a single Record). And thirdly, an Animal Source with a single Animal Source Record containing the oral swab.\nHow to track that these Source Records belong to the same cage? The database provide tags per user request that allow to label Sources Records that belong to units lower than Incidents and keep them linked in the data. In the example, the three Source Records can receive the same tag (“cage1”) in order to track that they have a more specific origin than Incident."

    "text": "4.5 SPECIMENS\nSpecimens correspond to material collected from Source Records to conduct Diagnostics in order to identify hazards (Biological, Chemical, Physical) or Physiological problems. The material collected can range from the full body to conduct an ultrasound in a live animal up to a trace of tissue to perform a highly technological assay. Invertebrate Source Records can have multiple species; however, it is expected that their Specimens do contain invertebrates belonging to the same species.\nSpecimens are characterized by an identifier, the type of material (water, hair, kidney, animal), the original amount (e.g., ‘full animal’ or 0.35 mm), the solution used to maintain them, and their storage type in the laboratory. Moreover, the database tracks the Specimen location (building, laboratory name, refrigerator name, etc), their availability, ownership, and current amount. The original amount and the current amount can differ if certain quantity of the original Specimen has already been used for previous Diagnostics.\nAnimal Specimens that are equivalent to the Animal Source Record (both are the ‘full animal’) must be given information at the Source Record level and at the Specimen level. The Source Record and Specimen could have the same identifier or a different one. The amount of the Specimen in those cases should be ‘full animal’.\nSpecimens whose current amount is zero must not be deleted from the database and their last location should remain.\nIt is possible that for lack of space or materials, more than one Specimen is stored in the same container. This strategy can cause cross contamination and make Specimen tracing more complicated. For this reason, Specimens can have a ‘Container’ identifier that is the same among Specimens sharing the same container. Although Specimens within the same container might not be labeled individually, a unique Specimen identifier must be provided in the database. This identifier can be the same as the container identifier plus an “organ name” or a numeric string at the end: “.1”, “.2”, etc. A description of each specific ‘Specimen’ within the container can be provided in ‘Comments’ allowing the identification of each tissue in the container as the corresponding Specimen."
