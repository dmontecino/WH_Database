    "text": "WildlifeHealthDat is a versatile database designed to manage wildlife health data collected from various surveillance efforts. These efforts encompass a wide range of activities, including citizen observations of dead, injured, or sick animals, specific research studies, national or local wildlife health surveillance initiatives, outbreak investigations, and global wildlife health surveillance projects involving multiple countries, hazards, and host species\nThe database draws upon the extensive experience of the Wildlife Conservation Society - Health Program, which spans several decades. This experience includes wildlife health surveillance activities conducted in numerous countries with several public and private partners; both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies; the establishment of wildlife health surveillance networks; investigation of diverse biological, chemical, and physical hazards; research on dangerous zoonotic pathogens like Ebola virus disease and SARS-CoV-2; first detection of emerging vector-borne pathogens such as West Nile virus; engagement of rangers in protected areas and nearby communities as key contributors to health surveillance; logistical challenges related to proper management, storage, and tracking of field-collected specimens; expertise in wildllife pathology; the use and development of various types of diagnostic tests, and prior experience in managing wildlife health data using different information management systems.\nThe wildlife health information is organized within the database using a structured hierarchy of components, starting from the highest level of “Projects” down to “Surveillance Objectives,” “Field Activities,” “Locations,” “Incidents,” “Sources,” “Records,” “Specimens,” and “Diagnostics.” While there are four types of sources in the database, it is modular in nature, allowing for customization and selection of specific components based on the requirements of each surveillance initiative. Detailed explanations of each component are provided in the following sections."

For example, during a single Field Visit, data may be collected from various Locations, such as two rehabilitation centers, a cave within a protected area, and three different areas within another protected area. In this case, there would be a total of six Locations. A Location serves as a way to group data in a more generalized manner compared to the exact latitude and longitude coordinates of the data collection (which are captured within the Incident component), but it provides more specificity than the overall ‘Field Activity’.\nIn the examples provided in the previous paragraph, a ‘market’ could be a ‘Location’ or an ‘Incident’ by itself depending on what the user considers the best choice for the corresponding Surveillance Objective. More detail about what an Incident represents is provided in the next section."

    "title": "Incidents",
    "section": "",
    "text": "An Incident refers to a distinct wildlife health event that occurs at a specific longitude and latitude on a particular date.\nThe definition of a wildlife health event, and thus the concept of an ‘Incident,’ varies depending on the Surveillance Objective methodology. In targeted surveillance efforts, an Incident may involve sampling healthy animals within a specific time and space to test them for a specific hazard. The inclusion of non-sampled individuals, as well as injured, sick, or dead animals, may or may not be considered part of the Incident.\nIf samples are collected from a river, the ‘Incident’ can be considered the location where the water is extracted. In the case of surveillance for vector-borne diseases, an Incident might represent a specific point in time and space where one or several traps for vectors have been placed. In scanning surveillance, an Incident could require the presence of at least one injured, sick, or dead animal, or a stranded individual. Additionally, healthy individuals found in the vicinity can also be included as part of the ‘Incident.’\nIn the case of beached fish, an Incident can represent each individual dead fish at one extreme, or the total count of dead fish across the beach as a single point in time and space at the other extreme. However, neither of these strategies is ideal. The former is not suitable for logistical purposes, while the latter results in the loss of valuable information regarding the distribution of dead fish across the beach. Therefore, an Incident should represent a unit between these two extremes.\nSimilarly, in the context of a wet market, the market can represent simultaneously an Incident and a Location. This Incident can gather data from multiple vendors, cages, and animals within the cages. On the other hand, a market could be considered a Location only, and each individual vendor within the market could be considered an Incident.\nA structured study can have multiple levels of hierarchy (zone, grid, area, trap, etc.) and one level receives the temporal-spatial coordinates (Incident). Another similarly structured study may provide the spatial coordinate to a different unit (e.g., area in one case and trap in another case).\nConsequently, an Incident can represent a wide range of units depending on the methodology used to record health data. Therefore, it is crucial to allow flexibility in what an Incident represents within a surveillance design and to explicitly declare its meaning as part of their data.\nIn the case of markets or structured studies, it may be desirable to group Incidents more specifically than simply under the general ‘Location’ category. For example, a market can be considered a ‘Location,’ and each cage could be treated as an ‘Incident.’ Users might want to further group cages by vendors and vendors by specific areas within the market. Similarly, in a structured study, the ‘Incident’ could represent a trap, and researchers may wish to group these Incidents based on areas, grid cells, zones, and seasons. Therefore, the database includes multiple ‘Incident’ tags to enable grouping on a finer scale than just the general ‘Location.’ Users can request specific tags as needed.\nIncidents can lack of any Sources (see below) if nothing is captured or sampled, but they can also have multiple Source Records of any type, depending on the specific findings and the interests of the corresponding Surveillance Objective."

    "section": "Observation",
    "text": "Observation\nAn Observation corresponds to the observed-only animal(s) present at one Incident grouped by species. For example, a wildlife health event involving a single isolated injured animal. If this individual is observed only, then the Incident has a single Observation representing a single species. The animal count for that single species is one.\nAnother example: five animals are found in a wetland, two of them of species “A” and three of them of species “B”. One animal of species “A” is sick. If they are only observed and the Surveillance Objective is not interested in individual animal-level data, then this set of findings is a wildlife health ‘Incident’ with two ‘Observations’. One ‘Observation’ represents species “A” (one healthy individual and one sick animal), and another ‘Observation’ represents species “B” (three healthy individuals).\nIncidents can include Observations (species) with healthy animals only, as long as they are part of a wildlife health event.\nEach Observation generates one and only one Source Record with immutable data. In that unique Source Record animals are categorized by sex, age, and health status. The captivity categories of the corresponding animals; their anomalies; and potential causes of injury, disease, or dead can be provided.\nIf the same set of only-observed animals is believed to be found five days later, then a new Observation must be created because there is no certainty that they are the same individuals. If users want to track the animals longitudinally, they should be added singly to the database as ‘Animal Source’ (see below)."

    "text": "Animal Source\nAn Animal Source represents an individual animal. Animal Sources can be added because the Surveillance Objective aims to collect individual-level health information (e.g., individual findings in stranded pilot whales), because the Animal Sources provide Specimens to perform Diagnostics or to be stored (carcass, body parts, tissue, organs, samples, etc), or because a Diagnostic is conducted in individual animals that do not necessarily provide Specimens (e.g., evident hair loss in a free-ranging red fox).\nImmutable data from Animal Sources are the sex, the species, and the date of death. Previous marking codes (if any have been used) are immutable; however, current marking codes are considered mutable and are provided in the corresponding Animal Source Record (see below).\n\nAnimal Source Record\nEach Animal Source has at least one Source Record. This first Source Record corresponds to the unique record of an unidentified individual animal or to the first record of an individually identified animal. Individually identified animals can potentially be tracked over time and have as many Source Records as needed.\nMutable data of an Animal Source over time needs to be provided for each Source Record. Mutable data includes the captivity category, the health status, the age, and the marking code. These are one-option features per Animal Source Record. Other mutable data for Animal Sources that can have multiple values in each Animal Source record are the anomalies found and the potential causes of injury, disease, or death. Obviously, the time t when the Animal Source is recorded is also mutable.\nThe last Animal Source Record for an animal is not necessarily the last time t when it was found dead because it is possible to collect Specimens from the carcass (dead Animal Source) over a period of time while the carcass is rooting.\n\n\nNecropsy\nNecropsies are associated with the specific Animal Source Record when the carcass was collected. However, the Necropsy date can be any date since the corresponding Animal Source Record creation.\nNecropsies can be primary or secondary. Primary necropsies usually start with an intact carcass (not previously used in a necropsy). Secondary necropsies are usually conducted by a veterinarian pathologist using pictures of the primary necropsy or using a carcass already necropsied.\nNew Specimens can be generated during a Necropsy (e.g., samples from organs). In this case, the date of Specimen collection is not the date of the Animal Source Record when the carcass was collected, but the date of the Necropsy (primary or secondary). It is possible to track if a Specimen was collected during the primary or secondary Necropsy based on the information collected in Specimens (see below)."

Environmental Sources do not have sex or date of death.\nImmutable data for Environmental Sources are the species (in the case of biotic Environmental Sources) and the Environmental Source type. Setting the Environmental Source type determines the Specimen type provided for those Sources (see ‘Specimens’ below). For example, feces can only yield feces as Specimens, and water in a pond can only provide water.\n\nEnvironmental Source Record\nEach Environmental Source has at least one Source Record.

If the same type of trap is placed in the same coordinates, then Invertebrate Sources can be tracked longitudinally; however, the invertebrate species collected each time the trap is set can be different. Invertebrate Sources do not have sex, age, captivity category, anomalies, health status, potential cause of death, etc.\nAn Invertebrate Source contains data from a collection of invertebrates.

    "text": "Final Comment on Sources and Source Records\nUsers can group Source Records from different Sources beyond the Incident they belong to. For example, a Surveillance Objective involves sampling animals and cages in a market as part of targeted surveillance efforts. One of the potential options to structure these data is to set the market as the Location and set each vendor within the market as an ‘Incident’. Let’s pretend that in one of the Incidents (a vendor), a sample of feces is collected from the bottom of a cage, the cage has three animals of the same species, and only one of those animals is sampled (one oral swab sample).\nUnder this scenario, the cage is providing three Source Records. Firstly, an Environmental Source with a single Environmental Source Record containing the feces sampled from the bottom of the cage. Secondly, an Observation with the two animals in the cage that are only observed (Observations always have a single Record). And thirdly, an Animal Source with a single Animal Source Record containing the oral swab.\nHow to track that these Source Records belong to the same cage? The database provides tags per user request that allow to label Sources Records that belong to units lower than Incidents and keep them linked. In the example, the three Source Records can receive the same tag (“cage1”) in order to track that they have a more specific origin than Incident."

    "title": "Specimens",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Specimens refer to the materials collected from Source Records for the purpose of conducting Diagnostics to identify hazards (biological, chemical, physical) or physiological problems. Specimens can range from the entire body of a living animal for conducting an ultrasound on to a minimal amount of tissue to perform advanced assays.\nSpecimens are characterized by an identifier, the type of material (water, hair, kidney, animal), the original amount (e.g., ‘full animal’ or 0.35 mm), the solution used for preservation, and the storage type in the field and in the storage location. Additionally, the database tracks the strorage location of the Specimens (building, laboratory name, refrigerator name, etc.), their availability, ownership, and current amount. It is important to note that the original amount and the current amount of a Specimen may differ if a portion of the original Specimen has already been used for Diagnostics.\nFor Animal Specimens that are equivalent to the Animal Source Record (both representing the ‘full animal’), information should be provided at both the Source Record and Specimen levels. The Source Record and Specimen can have the same identifier or different identifiers, and the amount of the Specimen in such cases should be indicated as ‘full animal’.\nInvertebrate Source Records may include multiple species; however, it is expected that the Specimens associated with these Records only contain invertebrates of the same species.\nSpecimens with a current amount of zero should not be deleted from the database, and their last known storage location should be retained.\nIn situations where space or materials are limited, it is possible that multiple Specimens are stored in the same container. This approach is not ideal because it can lead to cross-contamination and make actual Specimen tracing more complex. To address the tracing of these Specimens, a unique container identifier, such as a jar identifier, can be added in the database. Specimens sharing the same container will have the same container identifier. Although individual Specimens within the same container may not be labeled individually, each Specimen should be given a unique Specimen Code in the database. This Code can be the same as the container identifier, followed by the “organ name” or a numeric string (e.g., “.1”, “.2”, etc.). Specific details for each individual Specimen within the container, such as type, quantity, etc, should allow their visual identification within the container."

    "text": "Diagnostics encompass various techniques used to identify hazards (biological, chemical, physical) or physiological problems in Specimens obtained from Source Records. Each Diagnostic is designed for a specific targeted hazard, such as a viral family or a particular virus species. Diagnostics include three main components: type, method, and result.\nThe type of Diagnostic refers to a general category of diagnostic techniques, such as histopathology, serology, or imaging. Within each type, there are specific methods available, such as biopsy, ELISA assays, or X-rays. These methods can be applied at different levels, such as organs, serum, or specific body areas, respectively. This variability causes Specimens to range from full animals to a small sample.\nEach diagnostic method should provide a single result. However, it is possible to modify a diagnostic result in the database and provide a reason for the change.\nThe result of a Diagnostic should adhere to the case definition criteria established in the corresponding Surveillance Objective metadata for each declared method. Whenever possible, it is ideal to include supporting information such as digital images or files to corroborate the entered result in the database. If Diagnostics are performed under a new Surveillance Objective, such as testing a Specimen collected 50 years ago, this information must be provided in the Diagnostic data. As mentioned in the Surveillance Objective section, when a new Diagnostic is added, the corresponding Specimen, Source Record, and Source will be automatically assigned the new Surveillance Objective."
