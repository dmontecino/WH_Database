<!-- # Field Visit {.unnumbered} -->

A **Field Visit** in the data model represents a defined time period—including a start and end date—during which **Locations** are visited, **Events** and **Sources** are identified, and **Specimens** are collected and documented.

A **Field Visit** may encompass multiple **Locations** within the same trip, such as markets, natural areas, rehabilitation centers, caves, and more. While each **Field Visit** must include at least one Location, there is no upper limit to the number of **Locations** that can be visited during the trip. The length of a **Field Visit** is flexible.

Key properties of a **Field Visit** include:

* Start and End Date
* Field Visit ID and Code
* Field Visit Cross-Reference ID and Origin
* Field Visit Leader


If there are a **Field Visit** attributes that are not part of the current data model but are of interest to track, they must be reported in the **Surveillance Activity** metadata. It is recommended to maintain such additional attributes in a separate system, such as another database or an Excel sheet, for reference. Common extra **Field Visit** attributes can be added to the data model in the future. Missing options for single- and multi-selection attributes of **Field Visits** can be added as long as they maintain a controlled vocabulary to ensure consistency and data integrity.
