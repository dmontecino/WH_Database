<!-- # Field Visit {.unnumbered} -->

A Field Visit in the data model represents a time period, including a start and end date, to visit Locations, identify Events and Sources, collect Specimens (see below) and document data from them. A Field Visit can include various types of Locations (see below), such as markets, natural areas, rehabilitation centers, caves, etc. that are visited within the same trip and common start and end date. A Field Visit should include at least one Location up to an indefinite number of Locations (areas). 


Properties of a Field Visit include the Start and End Date, Field Visit ID, Field Visit Code, Field Visit Cross Reference ID, Field Visit Cross Reference Origin, Leader of the Visit, among others (see Data Dictionary). If the data of interest per Field Activity includes attributes that are not part of the data model, it has to be reported as part of the Surveillance Activity metadata and it is recommended to keep track of these attributes in a different source (another database, an excel sheet, etc.). Common extra Attributes can be added to the data model in the future. Missing Options for single- and multi-selection attributes of Field Visits can be added as long as they promote a controlled vocabulary.
