An Event in the data model refers to a distinct wildlife health event that occurs at a specific longitude and latitude on a particular date. A single Location can include between zero to a indefinite number of Events. 

The definition of a wildlife health event, and thus what an 'Event' represents, will inevitably vary depending on the Surveillance Activity and the particular definition of Event. For example, in active surveillance efforts, an Event can refer to the site and time where and when animals are captured to obtain Specimens. The site where a dead dead animal is found during a ranger patrol can be an Event. Furthermore, an 'Event' can be defined as the site where water is collected from a pond. In the case of surveillance for vector-borne diseases, an Event can represent a specific point in time and space where one or several traps for vectors are deployed. In the case of beached fish, an Event can represent each individual dead fish at one extreme, or the total count of dead fish across the beach as a single point in time and space at the other extreme. In the context of a wet market, the definition of Event can be applied to the market, or to the vendor, or to the stall, or to the cage. Structured studies can have multiple levels of hierarchy (zone, grid, area, trap, etc.) that represent can Event. For study A it could the grid cell whilst for study B it could each trap. 

Moreover, the presence of at least one Source could be needed to establish an Event. For example, a dead animal found during a ranger patrol. In Active Surveillance, an Event can occur without the presence of any Source, for example, when a capturing effort ended in the absence of animals captured. Additionally, the definition of an Event can include healthy animals found nearby a dead animal or animals not captured nearby animals captured, or not, depending on the Event definition.

Consequently, an Event in wildlife health surveillance can represent different spatio-temporal units depending on the objectives and the methodology used to collect wildlife health data. **It is up to the user to define what unit the  Event represents and report it in the Surveillance Activity metadata and it should be unique for a specific Surveillance Activity**. 

Properties of Event include the start and end date, a unique identifier, the cross referential identifier, longitude, latitude, the coordinate system reference used, the accuracy of the latitude and longitude valies, date-time, among others (see Data Dictionary).

Events can be clustered in units smaller than Location if needed. For a detailed explanation, see “Clustering of Locations, Events, and Source Records” section below.
