An Event in the data model refers to a distinct wildlife health event that occurs at a specific longitude and latitude on a particular date. A single Location (area) can include between zero to a indefinite number of Events (points). 

The definition of a wildlife health event, and thus what an 'Event' represents, will inevitably vary depending on the Surveillance Activity. For example, in active surveillance efforts, an Event can refer to the site and time where and when animals are captured to obtain Specimens, the site where a dead dead animal is found during a ranger patrol, the site where water is collected from a pond. In the case of surveillance for vector-borne diseases, an Event can represent a site where one or several traps for vectors are deployed. In the case of beached fish, an Event can represent each individual dead fish in one extreme, or the total count of dead fish across the beach reported as a single point in the other extreme. In the context of a wet market, the definition of Event can be applied to the market, or to the vendor, or to the stall, or to the cage. For study A the Event could the grid cell whilst for study B it could each trap. Structured/hierarchical/clustered/nested studies can have multiple levels (zone, grid, area, trap, etc.) that can represent an Event. 

Moreover, the presence of at least one Source could be needed to establish an Event. For example, a dead animal found during a ranger patrol. In Active Surveillance, an Event can occur without the presence of any Source, for example, when a collection effort ended in the absence of animals captured. Additionally, the definition of an Event can include or not healthy animals found nearby a dead animal or animals not captured nearby animals captured,  depending on the Event definition.

Consequently, an Event in wildlife health surveillance can represent different spatio-temporal point units depending on the objectives and the methodology used to collect wildlife health data. **It is up to the user to define what unit the  Event represents and report it in the Surveillance Activity metadata and it should be unique for a specific Surveillance Activity**. 

Properties of Event include the start and end date, a unique identifier, the cross referential identifier, longitude, latitude, the coordinate system reference used, the accuracy of the latitude and longitude valies, date-time, among others (see Data Dictionary). If the data of interest per Event includes attributes that are not part of the data model, it has to be reported as part of the Surveillance Activity metadata and it is recommended to keep track of these attributes in a different source (another database, an excel sheet, etc.)

Events can be clustered in nested or non-nested spatial units smaller than Locations if needed and also in nested and non-nested temporal clusters. For a detail explanation, see "Clustering of Locations, Events, and Source Records" section below.
