<!-- # Event {.unnumbered} -->

In the data model, an **Event** represents a distinct wildlife health event recorded at a specific longitude, latitude, and timestamp. Each **Event** is a point that can contain zero **Collections** (opportunistic detections of **Sources**) up to  an unlimited number of **Collections**.

The definition of a "wildlife health event", and therefore, what an **Event** represents in a **Surveillance Activity** will inevitably vary depending on the main epidemiological unit of interest and goals. Examples include:

* A site where *Animals* are captured at time *t* for **Specimen** collection
* The position and time a dead animal is found during a ranger patrol
* A position and time where water from a pond is sampled for analysis
* A site where one or several traps for vectors are deployed

In the case of beached fish, an **Event** can represent the position and time of recording of each individual dead fish in one extreme, or the total count of dead fish across the beach reported as a single point in the other extreme. In the context of a wet market, the definition of **Event** can be applied to the market, to vendors, to the stalls of vendors, or to the cages in the stalls at time *t*. For study A the **Event** could the grid cell where traps are deployed, whilst for study B it could each trap within a grid cell. 

In some cases, the presence of at least one **Source** may be required to establish an **Event**. For example: a dead animal found during a ranger patrol at time *t* creates an **Event**. 

In Active Surveillance, an **Event might not have any Source, for example, an Event containing a Collection that ends with no animals captured**.

An **Event** can include or not healthy animals. In the example of the dead animal found by the ranger at time *t*, it could be possible that the **Event** definition includes the documentation of healthy animals or not.

An **Event** can involve more than one **Source** type. For example, mosquito traps (*Arthropods*) and *Environmental* sampling under the same **Event**.

It is possible that specific latitude and longitude coordinates are not of interest in a **Surveillance Activity**. For example, a set of mosquito tramps deployed in parcels whose specific spatial location within each parcel is not relevant. In this case, the traps can be under a unique **Event** with an ID that links the traps at time *t* with the parcel where they were placed. In this case, the **Event** will still need spatial coordinates but they do not  represent the actual position of the **Collections**, Sources, etc.

This flexibility allows WHeDB to accommodate diverse surveillance strategies, ensuring meaningful and context-appropriate data representation.

**It is up to the user to define if the Event is a unit of interest and what it represents and to document this definition in the Surveillance Activity metadata. To ensure consistency, each Surveillance Activity must maintain a single, well-establish Event definition**.

Key attributes of a **Event** include:

* Start Date
* Event ID
* Event Code
* Event Cross-Reference ID
* Event Cross-Reference Origin
* Longitude & Latitude
* Coordinate Reference System (CRS) used

If there are a **Event** attributes that are not part of the current data model but are of interest to track, they must be reported in the **Surveillance Activity** metadata. It is recommended to maintain such additional attributes in a separate system, such as another database or an Excel sheet, for reference. Common extra **Event** attributes can be added to the data model in the future. Missing options for single- and multi-selection attributes of **Event** can be added as long as they maintain a controlled vocabulary to ensure consistency and data integrity.
