# Project

Project is a surveillance initiative supported by specific entities. For example,
the PREDICT Project funded by USAID, an isolated cross-sectional study with a
single field visit to a single location (sample collection in a market), or
a national or local wildlife health surveillance network lead by a
government agency. Projects are the highest hierarchical unit in the database
and they contain at least one surveillance objective.
