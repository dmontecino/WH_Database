<!-- # Project {.unnumbered} -->

A **Project** in the data model represents a surveillance initiative supported by specific entities. Examples include the PREDICT Project funded by USAID, a single cross-sectional study with one field visit to a specific location (e.g., sample collection in a market), or a national or local wildlife health surveillance network managed by a government agency.

**Projects** serve as the highest hierarchical unit in the database and must contain at least one **Surveillance Activity**. They can be time-limited, spanning a single date, or ongoing for an extended period as needed.

Key properties of a **Project** include:

* Project ID
* Project Code
* Project Cross-Reference ID
* Project Cross-Reference Origin
* Project Leader
* Project Funding Source
