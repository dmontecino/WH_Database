# THE WILDHEALTHDAT DATABASE

WildlifeHealthDat is a flexible database built to track wildlife health data 
collected from a wide range of surveillance efforts, including citizen observations
of dead, injured or sick animals, specific research, national or local wildlife health 
surveillance initiatives, outbreak investigations, and global wildlife health 
surveillance projects involving several countries, hazards, and host species. 

The database is based on the decades-long experience of the Wildlife Conservation
Society - Health Program. This experience includes wildlife health surveillance
activities covering dozens of countries; cross-sectional and longitudinal studies;
the establishment of wildlife health surveillance networks; many biological, 
chemical, and physical hazards; studying dangerous zoonotic pathogens, such as Ebola
virus disease  and SARS-CoV-2; emerging  vector-borne pathogens such as West Nile
virus; the inclusion of rangers in protected areas and surrounding communities 
as eyes-on-the-ground for health surveillance; the logistics needed and challenges
faced to properly manage, store, and track specimens collected in the field; 
necropsies; different kinds of diagnostic tests; and previous experiences managing
wildlife health data using different Information Managament Systems.

The wildlife health information is stored in the database following structured 
components ranging from Surveillance Objective up to Specimens and Diagnostic 
tests. The hierarchical  structure of the databse components is: i)  Projects >> 
Surveillance Objectives >> Field Activities >> Locations >> Incidents >> 
Sources >> Records >> Specimens >> Diagnostics. There are four types of Sources; 
however, the database is modular, adjusting and selecting those components 
needed specifically for each surveillance initiatives and their participants have.

Each one of these components is explained below.


## PROJECT

It is a surveillance initiative supported by specific entities. For example,
the PREDICT Project funded by USAID, an isolated cross-sectional study with a 
single field visit to a single location (sample collection in a market), or 
a national or local wildlife health surveillance network lead by a
government agency. Projects are the highest hierarchical unit in the database 
and they contain at least one surveillance objective. 

## SURVEILLANCE OBJECTIVE

It is a set of activities established to collect data in order to detect, quantify, 
or assess trends regarding specific health hazards in specific populations under a
common methodology. Each Surveillance Objective should have a specific population
and hazard target, Source or Specimen Collection methods, and Diagnostics. For 
example, a capture-mark-recapture study targeting lead accumulation in a specific
population of vultures that involves blood collection and testing at every capture
using the same diagnostic technique. Surveillance Objective is the most complicated
component of the database. Read this section carefully.

Surveillance Objectives contain very specific metadata, describing their goals and 
methods used, including targeted species, populations, and hazards; the type of 
Sources and Specimens included; collection methods; and case definitions for 
specific Diagnostics, Specimens, and Sources. Some pieces of the metadata are provided 
by Source type (Observation, Animal Source, Environmental Source, and Invertebrate
Source, [see below]).

Surveillance Objectives apply for targeted surveillance and scanning surveillance
initiatives so both types can be described through the metadata. All Outbreak 
Investigations are a Surveillance Objective, although the outbreak information 
(name and diagnosis) can be provided later and not immediately after the Surveillance
Objective creation in the database.


Usually, Field Activities, Locations, Incidents, Sources, Records, and Diagnostics
belong to a single Surveillance Objective. This Surveillance Objective
is the one that originally requested the Field Activity at different Locations to 
record the corresponding Incidents, collect the Sources and Specimens, and perform 
Diagnostics for a specific hazard. In this case, the Surveillance Objective is 
provided automatically to each corresponding component.

However, there are exceptions to this rule, except for Diagnostics, and the exceptions
have different justifications for each component. Field Activities, Locations,
Incidents, Source Records, and Specimens can be originally requested by different 
Surveillance Objectives planning the same activities and methods but that differ 
in the targeted hazard. For example, rodents sampled using the same methodology
that will be tested for Coronaviruses and Rickettsia sp. It is the user responsibility
to add the second Surveillance Objective to the corresponding Field Activities, 
Locations, Incidents, Source Records, and Specimens.

Another exception can occur when Source Records and Specimens collected under
scanning surveillance efforts are included in future targeted surveillance initiatives.
For example, using pangolin Specimens collected by rangers patrolling a protected 
area in 2017 under a scanning surveillance strategy that are  tested in 2023 for
SARS-CoV-2 as part of a targeted surveillance initiative. In this case, the 
corresponding Specimens tested for SARS-CoV-2 and their Sources will have more than
one Surveillance Objective. The one that originally demanded conducting the Field
Activity to collect the Source Record and Specimens, and the new Surveillance 
Objective targeting SARS-CoV-2. This last Surveillance Objective [DOES NOT]{.underline}
generate new Field Activities, Locations, or Incidents. Finally, each Diagnostic 
remains having a single Surveillance Objective (new Diagnostics targeting 
SARS-CoV-2 receive the SARS-CoV-2-related Surveillance Objective only).

Moreover, during Surveillance Objective targeting SARS-CoV-2 new Necropsies might
be conducted, new Specimens could be created (from larger stored Specimens, such
as a carcass or an organ), or new Pooled Specimens could be produced. All these 
components receive the Surveillance Objective targeting SARS-CoV-2 only. Again,
it is the user responsibility secondary Surveillance Objective to the corresponding
Source Records, Specimens and Diagnostics.

Therefore, a Surveillance Objective can be linked to others because they belong
to the same Project; they requested the same Field Activities, Locations, 
and  Incidents; or they have Sources and Specimens in common. If Surveillance 
Objectives are connected for the second and third reason, then this connection must
be provided in the metadata of the corresponding Surveillance Objectives. The 
connections will be also evident in the exported data such that each component with
more than one Surveillance Objective (Field Activity,..., Specimens) will be
represented by one row per Surveillance Objective.


## FIELD ACTIVITY

A Field Activity correspond to a field visit with a start and end date. Each one 
of these Field Visits could involve more than one Surveillance Objective (see above)
and Locations (see below) of different types such as markets, natural areas, 
rehabilitation centers, caves, etc.

## LOCATIONS

A Location is a general place where Incidents, Source Records, and Specimens are
collected. For example, a single Field Visit could involve different places: 
two rehabilitation centers, one cave in a protected area, and  three areas of another
protected area. These examples include six Locations. A Location groups data in a
more general manner than the exact longitude and latitude of the data collection 
(see 'Incidents' below that contain the latitude and longitude information) 
but that is more specific than 'Field Activity'. 

In the examples provided in the previous paragraph, a 'market' could be a 'Location'
or an 'Incident' by itself (see below) depending on what the user considers the 
best choice for the corresponding Surveillance Objective. More detail about what an
Incident represents is provided in the next section.

## INCIDENTS

An Incident is a specific wildlife health event at specific longitude and latitude
and that occurs in a specific date.

The definition of what a wildlife health event (and therefore of the 'Incident'
component) depends on the Surveillance Objective methodology. In targeted surveillance
efforts, an Incident could imply just healthy animals sampled in a specific 
time-space unit to test them for the targeted hazard. Non-sampled individuals,
injured, sick, or dead may or may not be included as part of the Incident. 
If samples are collected from a river, then the 'Incident' can be equivalent to
the location where water is extracted at. For the surveillance of vector-borne 
diseases, an 'Incident' could be a point in time and space where one to several
traps for vectors have been placed. For scanning surveillance, an 'Incident' could
require the presence of at least one injured, sick, or dead animal, or an stranded
individual. The 'Incident' can also include the healthy individuals found nearby.

In the case of beached fish, an Incident could represent each dead fish 
in one extreme. On the other extreme an Incident can represent to the full count
of dead fish across the beach as a single point in time and space. None of these
strategies seem ideal. The former, for logistic purposes and the latter, for the 
loss of valuable information (distribution of the dead fish across the beach). 
So an Incident should represent a unit in between. 

Similarly, an entire market could represent a 'Location' and a single 'Incident' 
at the same time. This Incident can gather data from several vendors, cages, and
animals within cages. On the other hand, a market could be a 'Location' and each
vendor within the market could be an 'Incident'. Finally, a structured
study can involve several levels of hierarchy and one of them receives the 
temporo-spatial coordinate. Another similar structured study (zone, 
grid, area, trap, etc.) might provide the spatial coordinate to a different unit 
(for example the area in one case and the trap in another case). Therefore, 
an Incident can represent a wide range of units depending on the methodology used
to record health ata. For this reason, it is necessary to provide flexibility to what
an Incident is per surveillance design and it is also necessary to request and 
explicitly declare what an Incident represents as part of its data.

In the market example or structured studies, it could be desired to group Incidents
more specifically than under the general 'Location'. For example, a market can be
a 'Location' and each cage could represent an 'Incident'. It is possible that users
want to group cages by vendors and vendors by area within the market, Similarly,
it is possible that in a structured study the 'Incident' represents a trap, and 
the researchers want to group traps these Incidents by area, grid cell, zone, and
season. For this reason, the database contains several 'Incident' tags to group 
them temporally, spatially, or both in a finer scale than Location. Specific tags
can be requested by users.

Incidents must have at least one Source Record from one Source type (see below) 
and as many Source Records of any type as needed (depending on what is found/recorded
in each specific Incident and what is the interest of the corresponding Surveillance 
Objective).

## SOURCES AND SOURCE RECORDS

A Source is an entity of interest within each Incident from which health information
is collected or generated. There are four classes of Sources with different properties:
Observations, Animal Source, Environmental Source, and Invertebrate Source (see below
for a full description of each type). Following the modular properties of the 
database, the Source types become available depending on the Surveillance Objective
methods and goals per user request.

Each Source contains at least one Source Record (Source recorded at time t). 
Depending on the type, a Source can be recorded multiple times (several Source
Records). For example, a capture-mark-recapture study with animals bled and tested
at each capture instance. Obviously, the first time a Source is entered in the 
database corresponds to its first Source Record.

The Source has immutable information over time. A Source Record has information 
of a specific Source that is mutable over time. Most Sources can provide
Specimens such as full carcasses, body parts, fluids, tumors, blood, water, sediment,
invertebrates, etc. These Specimens can be obtained during any of the Source Records 
of the corresponding Source.

Observations provide only a single Source Record (see below). Animal Sources, 
Environmental Sources, and Invertebrate Sources can provide as many Source Records
as needed. 

### Observation

An Observation corresponds to [observed-only animal(s)]{.underline} present at one 
Incident [grouped by species]{.underline}. For example, a wildlife health event 
involving a single isolated injured animal. If this individual is 
observed only, then the Incident has a single Observation representing a single 
species. The animal count for that single species is one. 

Another example: five animals are found in a wetland, two of them of species "A" 
and three of them of species "B". One animal of species "A" is sick. If they are
only observed and the Surveillance Objective is not interested in individual 
animal-level data,then this set of findings is a wildlife health 'Incident' with
two 'Observations'. One 'Observation' represents species "A" (one healthy individual
and one sick animal), and another 'Observation' represents species "B" (three 
healthy individuals).

Incidents can include Observations (species) with healthy animals only, as long
as they are part of a wildlife health event.

Each Observation generates one and only one Source Record. In that unique Record 
for the Observation animals are categorized by sex, age and health status. The
captivity categories of the corresponding animals; their anomalies; and potential
causes of injury, disease, or dead can be provided.

If the same set of only-observed animals are believed to be found five days latter,
then a new Observation must be created because there is not certainty that they 
are the same individuals. If users want to track the animals longitudinally, 
they should be added singly to the database as 'Animal Source' (see below).

### Animal Source

An Animal Source represents an individual animal. Animal Sources 
can be added because the Surveillance Objective aims to collect individual-level
health information (e.g., individual findings in stranded pilot whales), because 
the Animal Sources provide Specimens to perform Diagnostics or to be stored (carcass,
body part, tissue, organs, samples, etc), or because a Diagnostic is conducted in
individual animals that do not necessarily provide Specimens (e.g., evident hair
loss in a free-ranging red fox). 

Immutable data of Animal Sources are the sex, the species, and the date of death.
Previous marking codes (if any has been used) are immutable; however, current marking
codes are considered mutable and are provided in the corresponding Animal Source
Record (see below).

#### Animal Source Record

Each Animal Source has at least one Source Record. This first Source Record corresponds
to the unique record of an unidentified individual animal or to the first record
of an individually identified animal. Individually identified animals can potentially
be tracked over time and have as many Source Records as needed.  

Mutable data of an Animal Source over time that is provided for each Source Record
are the captivity category, the health status, the age, and the marking code. 
These are one option features per Animal Source Record. Other mutable data for 
Animal Sources that can have multiple values in each Animal Source record are 
the anomalies found and the potential causes of injury, disease, or death.

The last Animal Source Record for an animal is not necessarily the last time t when
it was found dead because it is possible to collect Specimens from the carcass (dead 
Animal Source) over a period of time while the carcass is rooting. 

#### Necropsies

Necropsies are associated with the specific Animal Source Record when the carcass
was collected. However, the Necropsy date can be any date since the corresponding
Animal Source Record creation.

Necropsies can be primary or secondary. Primary necropsies usually start with an
intact carcass (not previously used in a necropsy). Secondary necropsies are usually
conducted by a veterinarian pathologist using pictures of the primary necropsy or
using a carcass already necropsied.

New Specimens can be generated during a Necropsy (e.g., samples from organs). In 
this case the date of Specimen collection is not the date of the  Animal Source 
Record when the carcass was collected, but the date of the Necropsy (primary or 
secondary). It is possible to track if a Specimen was collected during the 
primary or secondary Necropsy based on the information collected in Specimens 
(see below).

### Environmental Sources



### Invertebrate Sources

Designed to contain data of a collection of invertebrates. If the interest is at
the individual level (e.g., bees with problems in their wings), then the data 
should be recorded as Animal Source
