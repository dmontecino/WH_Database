# PROJECT

It is a surveillance initiative funded by specific entities, during specific 
time in specific locations (e.g., the PREDICT Project or a minimum of a 
cross-sectional study with total n=2 collected during a single field visit 
in a single location. Rangers recording observations-only during their patrols are part of a National Wildlife Health Surveillance and the ranger recording observations are part of a surveillance objective [see below]).


A Project contains the Surveillance Objectives.


# SURVEILLANCE TASK

What is the Objective to Record and Collect Observations and Sources? 
How were the Observations, Animal Sources, Environmental Sources, 
Invertebrate Sources recorded; the Animal Specimens, Environmental Specimens, 
and Invertebrate Specimens collected, 


They are applied to tag Observations and Sources at time t collected to be tested
for specific hazards

Observations and Source Records can receive multiple Surveillance Tasks and 
Surveillance Tasks can include multiple Observations and Source Records.

Surveillance Tasks Apply only for Targeted Surveillance and Scanning Surveillance
Initiatives. Including Scanning Surveillance allows to have specific metadata
for the methods used in this type of surveillance strategy

Observations and Source Records may be included in future targeted surveillance 
initiatives. For example, test pangolins for SARS-CoV-2 in 2023, using samples 
collected by rangers patrolling a protected area in 2017. In this case, the 
collection of pangolin specimens by rangers is scanning surveillance; however,
a new task can be targeting SARS-CoV-2 specifically and using these specimens.

Each Surveillance Task can involve multiple Hazards. 
  Why asking then if a Pathogen, Chemical, Biological, or Physiological Hazard
  is targeted? 
  Because, the a user can look for all the Surveillance Tasks aimed to a 
  specific type of Hazard.

The targeted hazards are a Surveillance Task property and not Observation, 
Animal Source, Environmental Source, or Invertebrate Source property.

Each Surveillance Task can have many Observations, Animal Source, 
Environmental Source, and Invertebrate Source metadata. The metadata for each
Surveillance Task is provided by taxa (observations, animal sources, 
environmental sources, and invertebrate sources). The taxon could be as general
as "Arthropod" or specific to a species (Genus species).

All Outbreak Investigations are a Surveillance Task. An Outbreak Investigation may target several hazards.

associated with the Project do not add new Observations, Animal Source Records, 
Environmental Source Records, or Invertebrate Source Records, it means that the 
Project is relying on Source Records or Specimens already available and entered 
in the Wildlife Health Database. Basically, the Project is conducting necropsies
and diagnostics with available Specimens, or creating new Pooled Specimens
to run diagnostics

# FIELD ACTIVITY

Activity to Observations, Animal Sources, Environmental Sources, 
Invertebrate Sources recorded; the Animal Specimens, Environmental Specimens, 
and Invertebrate Specimens collected

A Project can contain many Field Activities


# SOURCES

## Invertebrate Sources

Designed to contain data of a collection of invertebrates. If the interest is at the individual level (e.g., bees with problems in their wings), then the data should be recorded as Animal Source
