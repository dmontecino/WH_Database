# THE WILDHEALTHDAT DATABASE

WildlifeHealthDat is a flexible database built to track wildlife health data 
collected from a wide range of surveillance efforts, including citizen observations
of dead or sick animals, specific studies, national or local wildlife health 
surveillance initiatives, outbreak investigations, and global wildlife health 
surveillance projects involving several countries, hazards and host species. 

The database has been built using the decades-long accumulated experience of 
the Wildlife Conservation Society - Health Program. This experience includes
wildlife health surveillance activities covering dozens of countries; cross-
sectional and longitudinal studies; the establishment of wildlife health surveillance
networks; many biological, chemical, and physical hazards; studying dangerous 
zoonotic pathogens, such as Ebola virus disease  and SARS-CoV-2; emerging 
vector-borne pathogens such as West Nile virus; the inclusion of rangers in 
protected areas and surrounding communities as eyes-on-the-ground; the logistics
needed and challenges faced to properly manage, store, and track specimens 
collected in the field; necropsies; and different kinds of diagnostic tests.

The database is modular, adjusting its complexity to the specific needs that 
surveillance initiatives and their participants have depending on the wildlife 
health surveillance goals and the subsequent type of data generated. The 
information to be stored in the database ranges from a specific projects up to 
specimen management and diagnostic tests.

The database has a general hierarchical structure: i)  Projects >> 
Surveillance Objectives >> Field Activities >> Locations >> Incidents >> 
Sources >> Records >> Specimens >> Diagnostics. Each one of these units is explained 
below.

## PROJECT

It is a surveillance initiative supported by specific entities. For example,
the PREDICT Project funded by USAID, an isolated cross-sectional study with a 
single field visit to a single location (sample collection in a market), or 
a national or local wildlife health surveillance network lead by the corresponding
government unit. Projects are the highest hierarchical unit in the database 
containing at least one surveillance objective. 

## SURVEILLANCE OBJECTIVE

It is a set of activities established to collect data in order to detect, quantify, 
or assess trends regarding specific hazards in a specific population and using a
specific methodology to records Sources and collect and test Specimens. For example,
a capture-mark-recapture study targeting lead accumulation in a specific population
of vulturesthat involves blood collection and testing at every capture and the same
diagnostic technique. Each Surveillance Objective should have a specific hazard target, 
Source or Specimen Collection methods, and Diagnostics. 

Surveillance Objectives contain very specific metadata, describing their goals and 
methods used, including targeted species, populations, and hazards; the type of 
Sources and Specimens included; collection methods; and case definitions for 
specific Diagnostics, Specimens, and Sources. Some pieces of the metadata are provided 
by Source type (Observation, Animal Source, Environmental Source, and Invertebrate
Source). Following the modular properties of the database, the Source type data 
requested to users will depend on the methods of each Surveillance Objective. 

Surveillance Objectives that involve the active recording of  
Sources at time t and the collections of Specimens have at least one Field 
Activity, Location, Incident, and Source. However, a Surveillance Objective
"B" might use Source Records or Specimens collected under Surveillance Objective
"A" to quantify other hazards, re-test specimens, or test for other hazards. 
In this case, Surveillance Objective "B" does not generate a new Field Activity, 
Location, or Incident; but it does use Source Records and Specimens. Therefore, 
Field Activities, Locations, and  Incidents, can only have one Surveillance 
Objective ("A" in the example), but Source Records, Specimens, and Diagnostics
can have more than one ("A" and "B" in the example). Specimens previously collected 
under Surveillance Project "A" that are pooled (generating a new Pooled Specimen
in the database) under a new Surveillance Objective "B" must also be assigned to
both Surveillance Objectives.

Furthermore, a single Field Activity and the corresponding Location(s) and 
Incident(s) can be associated with the collection or Source Records or Specimens
that will be used to assess different hazards. This scenario translates into 
different Surveillance Objectives (for different hazards); therefore, Field 
Activities, Location, and Incidents can have more than one Surveillance Objective
also.

Finally, not all the Specimens from Surveillance Objective "A" will necessarily
be part of Surveillance Objective "B" and similar with other higher units (Source
Records, Incidents, etc). So adding a Surveillance Objective "B" to a Source Record
does not have a cascade effect (adding a Surveillance Objective "B" to a Source
Record DOES NOT populate the corresponding Specimens, if any, of the corresponding
Source).

Surveillance Objectives can be linked to each other through "Project" 
(different Surveillance Objectives under the same Project), but they could also be
linked through their use in the same Field Activities, Locations, Incidents, Source 
Records or Specimens. This second type of connection is provided in the metadata
of the corresponding Surveillance Objectives and it is is also evident in the exported
data such that each unit (Field Activity,..., Specimens) is represented by one row 
per Surveillance Objective (if a unit has two Surveillance Objectives, then the unit 
is represented by two rows with differet values in the Surveillance Objective column). 

In summary, Field Activities, Locations, Incidents, Source Records and Specimens
can belong to multiple Surveillance Objectives and a single Surveillance Objective
can include multiple Field Activities, Locations, Incidentes, Source Records and
Specimens.

Surveillance Objectives apply for targeted surveillance and scanning surveillance
initiatives so both types can be described through the metadata. Source Records 
and Specimens from scanning surveillance efforts can be included
in future targeted surveillance initiatives. For example, using pangolin 
specimens collected by rangers patrolling a protected area in 2017 under a scanning
surveillance strategy that are test in 2023 for SARS-CoV-2 specifically. 

All Outbreak Investigations are a Surveillance Objective, although the outbreak 
information (name and diagnosis) can be provided later and not immediately after the 
Surveillance Objective creation in the database.

## FIELD ACTIVITY

A Field Activity correspond to a field visit with a start and end date. Each one 
of these Field Visits could involve more than one Surveillance Objective (e.g., 
sampling the same hosts for different hazards) and the visit to different types
of places such as markets, natural areas, rehabilitation centers, caves, etc. A 
Field Activity can encompass one or several types of places.

## LOCATIONS

A Location is a general place where Incidents, Source Records, and Specimens are
collected during a Field Activity. For example, a single Field Visit could involve
different places: two rehabilitation centers, one cave in a protected area, and 
three areas of another protected area. These examples include six Locations. A 
Location groups data in a more general manner than the exact longitude and latitude
of the data collection (see 'Incidents' below that contain the latitude and longitude
information) but that is more specific than the 'Field Activity'. 

In the examples provided in the previous paragraph, a 'market' could be a 'Location'
or an 'Incident' by itself (see below) depending on what the user considers the 
best choice for the corresponding Surveillance Objective. More detail about what an
Incident represents is provided in the next section.

## INCIDENTS

An Incident is a specific spatial coordinate that receives a longitude and a latitude
and they occur in a specific date.

In our experience, an Incident can represent a wide range of units depending on 
the methodology used to record data. For example, in the case of beached fish, 
an Incident could represent each dead or sick fish in one extreme up to the count
count of dead or sick fish as a single point representing the entire in the other
extreme.None of these strategies seem ideal for logistic purposes in the former 
and the loss of valuable information in the latter. So an Incident should represent
a concept in between. Similarly, an entire market could be a 'Location' and a single
'Incident' that has data from several vendors, cages, and animals within. On the
other hand, a market could be a 'Location' and each vendor within the market could
be an 'Incident' with a longitude and latitude. Finally, a structured study can 
involve several levels of hierarchy and one of them receives the spatial coordinate.
Similar structured studies involving a zone, grid, area, trap, etc. might provide
the spatial coordinates to a different unit (for example the area in one case and
the trap in another case). Following these examples, it is necessary to provide 
flexibility to what an Incident is but it is also necessary to declare 
what the Incident represents.

In the market example or structured studies, it could be desired to group Incidents
below the general 'Location' through a set of tags. For example, a market can be
a 'Location' and each cage could represent an 'Incident'. It is possible that users
want to group cages by vendors and vendors by area within the market, or another
combinations. Similarly, it is possible that in a structured study the 'Incident'
represents a trap, and the researchers want to group traps (Incidents) by area, 
grid cell, zone, and season. For this reason, the database contains several 'Incident'
tags to geroup them temporally, spatially, or both. New tags can be requested by 
specific users.

## SOURCES

### Observations

### Animal Sources

### Environmental Sources

### Invertebrate Sources

Designed to contain data of a collection of invertebrates. If the interest is at the individual level (e.g., bees with problems in their wings), then the data should be recorded as Animal Source
