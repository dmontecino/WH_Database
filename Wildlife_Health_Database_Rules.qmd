# Surveillance Task

What is the Objective to Record and Collect Observations and Sources? 

They are applied to tag Observations and Sources at time t. 

Observations and Source Records can receive multiple Surveillance Tasks and 
Surveillance Tasks can include multiple Observations and Source Records.

Surveillance Tasks Apply only for Targeted Surveillance and Scanning Surveillance
Initiatives. Including Scanning Surveillance allows to have specific metadata
for the methods used in this type of surveillance strategy

Observations and Source Records may be included in future targeted surveillance 
initiatives. For example, test pangolins for SARS-CoV-2 in 2023, using samples 
collected by rangers patrolling a protected area in 2017. In this case, the 
collection of pangolin specimens by rangers is scanning surveillance; however,
a new task can be targeting SARS-CoV-2 specifically and using these specimens.

Each Surveillance Task can involve multiple Hazards. 
  Why asking then if a Pathogen, Chemical, Biological, or Physiological Hazard
  is targeted? 
  Because, the a user can look for all the Surveillance Tasks aimed to a 
  specific type of Hazard.

The targeted hazards are a Surveillance Task property and not Observation, 
Animal Source, Environmental Source, or Invertebrate Source property.

Each Surveillance Task can have many Observations, Animal Source, 
Environmental Source, and Invertebrate Source metadata. The metadata for each
Surveillance Task is provided by taxa (observations, animal sources, 
environmental sources, and invertebrate sources). The taxon could be as general
as "Arthropod" or specific to a species (Genus species).

All Outbreak Investigations are a Surveillance Task. An Outbreak Investigation
may target several hazards.
