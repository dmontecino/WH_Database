# Location {.unnumbered}

A Location refers to a general place where Incidents, Source Records, and Specimens are collected. It represents an area where data is gathered. For example, during a single Field Visit, data may be collected from various Locations, such as two rehabilitation centers, a cave within a protected area, and three different areas within another protected area. In this case, there would be a total of six Locations. A Location serves as a way to group data in a more generalized manner compared to the exact latitude and longitude coordinates of the data collection (which are captured within the Incident component), but it provides more specificity than the overall 'Field Activity'.

In the examples provided in the previous paragraph, a 'market' could be a 'Location' or an 'Incident' by itself depending on what the user considers the best choice for the corresponding Surveillance Objective. More detail about what an Incident represents is provided in the next section.
