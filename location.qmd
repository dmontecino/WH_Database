<!-- # Location {.unnumbered} -->

A Location in the data model refers to a general area (polygon) where Events can be identified, and Source Records, Carcasses, and Specimens can be collected from. During a single Field Visit, data may be collected from various Locations, such as two rehabilitation centers, or three different zones within another protected area. In this case, there would be a total of five Locations. Therefore, a Location serves as a way to group data in areas compared to the Events that group data under a exact latitude and longitude ('Event'; see below). 

What a 'Location' represents will inevitably vary depending on the Surveillance Activity methodology. For example, for the collection of arthropods, a Location can represent a parcel where traps are set. In a structured/hierarchical/clustered/nested research, the Location could represent a grid cell. In ranger patrols, the Location can correspond to either the full protected area, or a specific zone within the protected area. **It is up to the user to define what unit the Location area represents and report it in the Surveillance Activity metadata**. 

Properties of Location include the start and end date, a unique identifier, the cross referential identifier, the type of location, environmental characteristics, among others (see Data Dictionary). If the data of interest per Location includes attributes that are not part of the data model, it has to be reported as part of the Surveillance Activity metadata and it is recommended to keep track of these attributes in a different source (another database, an excel sheet, etc.)

Locations can be clustered in larger nested or non-nested spatial units if needed. For a detail explanation, see "Clustering of Locations, Events, and Source Records" section below.
