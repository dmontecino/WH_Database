<!-- # Location {.unnumbered} -->

A Location in the data model refers to a general place where Events, Source Records, Carcasses, and Specimens can be collected from. During a single Field Visit, data may be collected from various Locations, such as two rehabilitation centers, a cave within a protected area, or three different zones within another protected area. In this case, there would be a total of six Locations. Therefore, a Location serves as a way to group data in a more generalized manner compared to the exact latitude and longitude coordinates where data is collected ('Event'; see below), but it provides more specificity than the overall 'Field Activity'. 

What a 'Location' represents will inevitably vary depending on the Surveillance Activity methodology. For example, for the collection of arthropods, a Location can represent a parcel where traps are set. In a structured research, the Location could represent a grid cell. In ranger patrols, the Location can correspond to either the full protected area, or a specific zone within the protected area. **It is up to the user to define what unit the Location represents and report it in the Surveillance Activity metadata**. 

Properties of Location include the start and end date, a unique identifier, the cross referential identifier, the type of location, environmental characteristics, among others (see Data Dictionary).

Locations can be clustered in units smaller than Field Visit if needed. For a detail explanation, see "Grouping of Locations, Events, and Source Records" section below.
