<!-- # Location {.unnumbered} -->

In the data model, a **Location** represents a general area (polygon) where **Events** can be identified and **Source Records**, **Carcasses**, and **Specimens** can be collected. Unlike **Events**, which are defined by exact latitude and longitude coordinates, **Locations** serve as a broader spatial grouping for organizing data. A single Location can contain zero Events (e.g., when an area is surveyed but no **Event** is recorded) or multiple **Events** (e.g., multiple observations or findings within the same area).

The meaning of a **Location** depends on the methodology of the **Surveillance Activity**. For *Arthropod* collection, a **Location** may represent a parcel where traps are set. In a structured, hierarchical study, a **Location** could correspond to a grid cell.During ranger patrols, a **Location** might be defined as the entire protected area or a specific zone within it. **Users must define the specific unit a Location represents and document it in the Surveillance Activity metadata**.

Key attributes of a **Location** include:

* Location ID and Code
* Location Cross-Reference ID and Origin
* Location Type
* Environmental Characteristics

If there are a **Location** attributes that are not part of the current data model but are of interest to track, they must be reported in the **Surveillance Activity** metadata. It is recommended to maintain such additional attributes in a separate system, such as another database or an Excel sheet, for reference. Common extra **Location** attributes can be added to the data model in the future. Missing options for single- and multi-selection attributes of **Location** can be added as long as they maintain a controlled vocabulary to ensure consistency and data integrity.
