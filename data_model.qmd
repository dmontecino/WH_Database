## Introduction

HAWK's **data model** is designed accommodate wildlife health data from various sources, including local to national wildlife health surveillance systems, research initiatives, and citizen-science based projects. 

HAWK structures wildlife health surveillance data following a hierarchy, capturing relevant epidemiological information at each step. The full hierarchy includes:

1. **Projects**: A set of *Surveillance Activities* with a common leader and organizer (e.g., a national wildlife health surveillance system).
2. **Surveillance Activities**: Specific sets of surveillance goals and methodology (who, where, when, what, why, how) documented following a standard metadata format.
3. **Field Visits**: Time period during which activities are conducted in the field.
4. **Locations**: Specific areas where activities are conducted.
5. **Collection Areas** and **Collection Points**: Effort units associated with the generation of data in a explored area (e.g., sector within protected area) and in a linear feature (e.g., transect or ranger patrol track), respectively.
6. **Events**: Point epidemiological units with a spatiotemporal coordinate where wildlife health surveillance data is collected.
7. **Point Collection**: Effort units associated with the generation of data in an **Event** (e.g., a set of mist nests placed during a specific period of time).
8. **Sources**: Units that can provide Specimens for hazard detection or whose health is assessed (observed-only) at a specific time. There are four Source types:â€‹
      * *Group*: groups of animals of the same species.
      * *Animal*: individual animals
      * *Environmental*: environmental sampling sites (e.g., ponds or feces in the field).
      * *Arthropod*: arthropod capture sites.
9. **Source Records**: Records of the Sources at a specific time *t*.
10. **Specimens**: Tissues taken from *Source Records*.
11. **Diagnostics**: Tests conducted on *Sources* or collected *Specimens* to assess health hazards.
12. **Results**: The result(s) of a *Diagnostic* for the targeted hazard(s) and the corresponding interpretation for each hazard.
12. **Interpretation**: The final status assigned to a *Specimen* or *Source Record* following documented case definitions.
 
**The basic relationships among the basic units of the data model** are shown in Figure 1 below:

**Figure 1**: Basic relationships among the basic units of the data model.

HAWK employs a modular approach to the data model, enabling components to be added based on the specific WHS needs. When data comes from wildlife mortality reported by a community member through a mobile application:

* The *Surveillance Activity* contains a description of the methodology.
* The *Field Visit* could be defined annually to categorize reports by year.
* The *Location* could be a county or zip code.
* An *Event* is the epidemiological unit with latitude, longitude, and time representing the position where dead animals found.
* The *Animal Source Records* describe the dead animals.
* No Specimens, Diagnostics, or Laboratory data are generated.
* No Collection effort is linked to the Events and the animals are found opportunistically.

**Figure 2**: Components of the data model to contain data from example 1.

This flexible structure ensures that the model remains efficient and scalable, adapting to different surveillance needs.

<!-- The next example is a series of surveys in wildlife farms to identify pathogens. Surveys are conducted every 3 months and each one of them include all the farms in the study. The farms are distributed in several counties. Each farm has several species that are distributed in barns, aisles, pens, and cages. Seasonal changes are assessed as well. All the animals of the cages will be sampled (rectal and oral swab each one). Fecal samples will be collected from the cages directly as well. Finally, each sample will be tested for 3 pathogens. In this example, there could be a single Surveillance Activity with the three pathogens included, or three Surveillance Activities with the same methods except the targeted hazards (one Surveillance Activity per pathogen is recommended). The data includes **Field Visits every three months**. Each one of these Field Visits includes all the counties were the farms are located. If each farm is a Location, then the Locations must be clustered by county. Also, if the Event within each farm is a cage with animals, then the Events must be clustered by pen, aisles, and barns. In the manner the structure of the data is Field Visit, county (cluster), farms (Location), barns (cluster), aisles (cluster), pens (cluster), and cages (Event). Depending on the number of cages per pen, there could be multiple or a unique Event per pen. Each Event will have as many Sources at time *t* as animals are per each cage. Continuing with the animals (Sources), two Specimens are collected from each one of them and they are tested for three pathogens for a total of six tests per individual. Furthermore, each cage Event also has a Group Source Record, corresponding to the animals that are in the cage as a group. This Group Source Record has a fecal Specimen associated also tested for three pathogens. -->

The data model is **not designed for wildlife population monitoring**. However, it includes key identifiers that enable seamless integration between wildlife health and population data.

More complex relationships between the fundamental units of the data model, as well as additional details, are covered in the **Complexities** section. Before exploring these advanced topics, it is recommended to first understand the core components of the data model, from *Project* to *Diagnosis*, *Results*, and *Interpretation*, by continuing with this documentation.

# Complexities

## Storage

In the data model, Specimens from all Sources (including Diagnostic Products) and Carcasses of Animal Sources can be stored, their storage can be tracked, and changes in storage can be traced. 

## Export

In the data model, Specimens from all Sources (including Diagnostic Products) and Carcasses of Animal Sources can be exported and exportations can be tracked.

## Laboratories

The data model includes Laboratory entities. Laboratories can conduct Diagnostics to test for hazards in Specimens or in full Source Records (Field-based Diagnostics or simple Diagnostics conducted by people are also possible in the data model. See Diagnostics). Laboratory properties include address, manager, name, Laboratory ID, among others (Data Dictionary). It is also possible to store data regarding Laboratory capabilities in terms of diagnostic tests and storage, and their certifications (Bio safety levels, etc.)

## Interpretation

#### Interpretation of a hazard's detection in a Diagnostic

In the data model, Interpretation of a Diagnostic is the conclusion regarding the detection of a hazard using a Diagnostic targeting that specific hazard, based on a case definition for a positive, negative, or undetermined result provided in the Surveillance Activity metadata. Each Diagnostic receives one Interpretation only.

#### Interpretation of a hazard's presence in a Specimen

In the data model, Interpretation of a Hazard in a Specimen is the conclusion regarding the presence or absence of a specific hazard in a Specimen, based on a case definition for a positive, negative, or undetermined Specimen provided in the Surveillance Activity metadata. The interpretation follows the results from the Diagnostic(s) conducted using the Specimen and the corresponding Diagnostic(s) Interpretation(s). Specimens can receive multiple Interpretations if they are used to conduct several Diagnostics to assess several hazards or if the same hazard is assessed more than once in different diagnostics.

#### Interpretation of a hazard's presence in a Source Record

In the data model, Interpretation of a Hazard in a Source Record is the conclusion regarding the presence or absence of a specific hazard in a Source Record, based on a case definition for a positive, negative, or undetermined Source Record provided in the Surveillance Activity metadata. The interpretation follows the results of the Diagnostic(s) conducted using the Source Record, the Source Record Specimen(s), the corresponding Diagnostic(s), anomalies in the Source Record at a Event, and Necropsy findings.

Source Records can receive multiple Interpretations if multiple hazards are assessed in them or the same hazard is assessed more than once. Sources can have many Interpretations through several Source Records if multiple hazards are assessed in them at time *t* (Source Record), if the same hazard is assessed more than once at time *t* (Source Record), or if different or the same hazard are assessed over time (several Source Records of the same Source over time).
