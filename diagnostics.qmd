# Diagnostics {.unnumbered}

Diagnostics refer to any technique used to identify a hazard (Biological, Chemical, Physical) or a Physiological problem in any Specimen coming from any Source Record. Each Diagnostic is specific for a targeted hazard (e.g., a viral family or a virus species). Diagnostics have the main features: the type, the method, and the result.

The type of Diagnostic refers to a general class of Diagnostic techniques, for example, histopathology, serology, imaging, etc. There are specific Diagnostic methods within each type of Diagnostic, for example, biopsy, ELISA assays, and X-rays. These methods can be applied to different levels: an organ, serum, or a body area, respectively; and this is the argument for a Specimen to range from a full animal to any other smaller sample amount.

A single result is expected from each Diagnostic method; however, it is possible to modify a Diagnostic result in the database and provide the reason for the change.

The result of a Diagnostic must follow the case definition criteria established in the Surveillance Objective metadata for each method declared to be used. Ideally, supporting information, such as digital images or files, should support the result entered in the database. Diagnostics belonging to new Surveillance Objectives (e.g., testing a Specimen collected 20 years ago under another Surveillance Objective) must be provided in the Diagnostic data. As mentioned in the Surveillance Objective section, Surveillance Objectives added to a new Diagnostic will be automatically assigned to the corresponding Specimen, Source Record, and Source.
