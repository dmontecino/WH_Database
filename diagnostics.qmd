# Diagnostics {.unnumbered}

Diagnostics encompass various techniques used to identify hazards (biological, chemical, physical) or physiological problems in Specimens obtained from Source Records. Each Diagnostic is designed for a specific targeted hazard, such as a viral family or a particular virus species. Diagnostics include three main components: type, method, and result.

The type of Diagnostic refers to a general category of diagnostic techniques, such as histopathology, serology, or imaging. Within each type, there are specific methods available, such as biopsy, ELISA assays, or X-rays. These methods can be applied at different levels, such as organs, serum, or specific body areas, respectively. This variability causes Specimens to range from full animals to a small sample.

Each diagnostic method should provide a single result. However, it is possible to modify a diagnostic result in the database and provide a reason for the change.

The result of a Diagnostic should adhere to the case definition criteria established in the corresponding Surveillance Objective metadata for each declared method. Whenever possible, it is ideal to include supporting information such as digital images or files to corroborate the entered result in the database. If Diagnostics are performed under a new Surveillance Objective, such as testing a Specimen collected 50 years ago, this information must be provided in the Diagnostic data. As mentioned in the Surveillance Objective section, when a new Diagnostic is added, the corresponding Specimen, Source Record, and Source will be automatically assigned the new Surveillance Objective.
