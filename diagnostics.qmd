# Diagnostics {.unnumbered}

Diagnostics refer to any technique used to identify a hazard (Biological, Chemical, Physical) or Physiological problems in any type of Specimen coming from any type of Source Record. Each Diagnostic is specific for a targeted hazard (e.g., a viral family or a specific virus). Diagnostics have the main features: the type, and the method, and the result.

The type of Diagnostic refers to a general class of Diagnostic technique, for example, hystopathology, serology, imaging etc. Within each type of Diagnostic there are specific Diagnostic methods, for example, biopsy, ELISA assays, and X-rays. These example methods can be applied to different levels: an organ, serum, or a body area, respectively; and this is the argument why a Specimen can range from a full animal to any other smaller sample amount.

A single result is expected from each Diagnostic method; however, it is possible to modify the result of a Diagnostic in the database and provide the reason for the change.

The result of a Diagnostic must follow the case definition criteria established in the Surveillance Objective metadata for each method declared to be used. Ideally, supporting information such as digital images, files, etc. should be provided in order to back the result entered in the database. Diagnostics belonging to new Surveillance Objectives (e.g., testing a Specimen collected 20 years ago under another Surveillance Objective) must be provided in the Diagnostic data. As mentioned in the Surveillance Objective section, Surveillance Objectives added to a new Diagnostic will be automatically provided to the corresponding Specimen, Source Record, and Source.
