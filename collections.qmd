In the data model, a **Collection** represents the effort involved in observing, detecting, capturing, or otherwise identifying Sources at an **Event**, starting from the **Event** timestamp.

Examples of **Collections** include:

* The time spent by an observer at a fixed location to identify dead birds in a wetland, along with the tools used (e.g., telescope, binoculars).
* The number of camera traps deployed at a specific site to photograph a sick animal and the hours they were active.
* The distance and time traveled by a ranger to find a dead animal.
* The trap type, bait, deployment period, and number of traps used to collect mosquitoes at a given site.
* The distance traveled to obtain or observe *Sources* across a transect.

**A Collection can contain between zero and an unlimited number of Source Records**. For example, a capture effort that results in no animals caught.

**An Event might not include any Collection**. Examples include **Sources** found opportunistically (e.g., through news articles reporting wildlife health events) or survey and sampling of the animals in a wet market. In this case, the effort might not be a relevant unit for the **Surveillance Activity** (hours spent at the market) and can be ignored.

A **Collection** typically contains a specific type of **Source Record**. This is because observations, captures, and sampling efforts generally focus on a specific type of target, whether *Group*, *Animal*, *Environmental*, or *Arthropods*. However, a single **Event** can include multiple **Collections** targeting different objectives. For example, mosquito traps and an air filtration device can be linked to the same **Event**.

**Collections are defined by**: 

* The **number of units**, that  must be larger than zero.
* The type of spatial and temporal units associated with the completion of the **Collection** (e.g., "number of mist nets", "number of COâ‚‚ traps", "number of Camera traps", "distance walked"; and "area scanned").
* The position of the units with respect to the spatial coordinates of the **Event** (e.g., "at the Event"
"around the Event", "starting at the Event", "ending at the Event", "starting and ending at the Event").
* The position of the units with respect to the temporal coordinates of the **Event** (e.g., "starting at the Event", "ending at the Event").

For example, **1**, **observer standing**, and **at the Event** for number of spatial units, spatial unit, and spatial position with respect to the **Event**; and **6**, **hours observing with binoculars**, and **at the Event** for number of temporal units, temporal unit, and temporal position with respect to the **Event**, respectively. The attributes of a **Collection** completed through a transect can include **2**, **hours**, and **starting at the Event** for the temporal components, and **4**, **kilometers walked**, and **starting and ending at the Event** for the spatial components.

**Collections** also allow to characterize problems during the search for **Sources**, such as camera traps running out of battery or stolen, torn mist nets, etc. 

When **Source Records** are not associated to a **Collection** (e.g., opportunist finding of dead animals), the following properties are number of units = NA, unit = NA, and positioning with respect to the **Event** = NA

Key attributes of a **Collection** include:

* Collection ID
* Collection Code
* Collection Cross Reference ID
* Collection Cross Reference Origin

If there are a **Collection** attributes that are not part of the current data model but are of interest to track, they must be reported in the **Surveillance Activity** metadata. It is recommended to maintain such additional attributes in a separate system, such as another database or an Excel sheet, for reference. Common extra **Collection** attributes can be added to the data model in the future. Missing options for single- and multi-selection attributes of **Collection** can be added as long as they maintain a controlled vocabulary to ensure consistency and data integrity.
