<!-- # Surveillance Activity {.unnumbered} -->

A Surveillance Activity refers to a set of activities to collect data with the aim of detecting, quantifying, proving freedom of disease, or assessing trends of specific health hazards within specific populations, using a standardized methodology. Each Surveillance Activity should specify the target populations, hazard, Sources and Specimen collection methods, and Diagnostics (see below). A Surveillance Activity is a capture-mark-recapture study targeting lead accumulation in a specific vulture population involving the collection of blood samples and conducting tests using the same capture, marking, and Diagnostic methods.  Surveillance Activities encompass targeted surveillance, scanning surveillance, citizen science monitoring, freedom of disease assessments, and others. Surveillance Activities include detailed metadata that describe their objectives and methods, including information on the targeted species, populations, hazards, type of Sources and Specimens, collection methods, and case definitions for Diagnostics, Specimens, and Sources. Surveillance Activities are the most complex component of the database, so it is essential to read this section carefully.

Field Visits, Locations, Events, Sources, Records, and Diagnostics usually belong to a single Surveillance Activity. The Surveillance Activity that commanded the Field Visits at different Locations to document Events, collect Sources and Specimens, perform Diagnostics for a specific hazard, and provide Diagnosis for Diagnostics, Specimens, and Sources.

However, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, rodents trapped in the same Event may be sampled using the same methodology but tested for coronaviruses and Rickettsia sp. Therefore, two Surveillance Activities are involved. In this scenario, two Surveillance Activities should be assigned to the Field Visits, Locations, Events, Source Records, and Specimens. Diagnostics for either group of pathogens and the corresponding Diagnosis should only get a single Surveillance Activity.

Another exception occurs when Specimens were collected during past surveillance efforts but are included in new surveillance initiatives. For instance, using pangolin Specimens collected by veterinarians in 2017 and tested for Salmonella sps. which are then tested in 2023 for SARS-CoV-2. In this case, the latter Surveillance Activity is assigned only to the Specimens (as a second Surveillance Activity) and to the SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostics and Diagnosis. Therefore, the Specimens should have two Surveillance Objectives. The first one corresponds to the original Surveillance Objective that lead to their collection and the second one corresponds to the Surveillance Activity testing them for SARS-CoV-2.

Moreover, new Necropsies might be conducted or new Specimens could be created (from larger stored Specimens, such as a carcass or an organ) as part of a new Surveillance Activity,. The new Necropsy and Specimens should receive the second Surveillance Activity only. Diagnostics using the new Specimens should receive the second Surveillance Activity.

Therefore, Surveillance Activities can be interconnected for various reasons. These connections will be evident in the exported data, where each component with multiple Surveillance Activities (e.g., Specimen) will be represented by one row per Surveillance Activity.

## Outbreak Investigation

All outbreak investigations are considered Surveillance Activities. Outbreak Surveillance Activities can encompass the Field Visit that lead to the Outbreak detection and the following Field Visits associated with Outbreak investigation and control. The detection could have been made during a Field Activity conducted by rangers or hunters as part of disease monitoring. In this case the components of this Field Visit should be assigned to a scanning surveillance Surveillance Activity (the original purpose) and to the Outbreak Surveillance Activity. The following Field Activities that could be completed by veterinarians or public health officers, they all receive the outbreak Surveillance Activity.
