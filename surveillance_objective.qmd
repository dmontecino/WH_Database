# Surveillance Objective {.unnumbered}

Surveillance Objective is a set of activities established to collect data in order to detect, quantify, or assess trends regarding specific health hazards in specific populations under a common methodology. Each Surveillance Objective should have a specific population and hazard target, Source or Specimen Collection methods, and Diagnostics. For example, a capture-mark-recapture study targeting lead accumulation in a specific population of vultures involves blood collection and testing at every capture using the same diagnostic technique. Surveillance Objective is the most complicated component of the database. Read this section carefully.

Surveillance Objectives contain very specific metadata, describing their goals and methods used, including targeted species, populations, and hazards; the type of Sources and Specimens included; collection methods; and case definitions for specific Diagnostics, Specimens, and Sources. Some pieces of metadata are provided for each Source type (Observation, Animal Source, Environmental Source, and Invertebrate Source, \[see below\]).

Surveillance Objectives include targeted surveillance and scanning surveillance initiatives. 

Usually, Field Activities, Locations, Incidents, Sources, Records, and Diagnostics belong to a single Surveillance Objective. This Surveillance Objective is the one that originally requested the Field Activity at different Locations to record Incidents, collect the Sources and Specimens, and perform Diagnostics for a specific hazard. In this case, the Surveillance Objective is provided automatically to each corresponding component.

However, there are exceptions to this rule, except for Diagnostics, which have different justifications for each component. Field Activities, Locations, Incidents, Source Records, and Specimens can be originally requested by different Surveillance Objectives planning the same activities and methods but that differ in the targeted hazard. For example, rodents trapped in the same Incidents, sampled using the same methodology, and tested for both Coronaviruses and Rickettsia sp (two Surveillance Objectives). In this case, only one of the Surveillance Objectives will be automatically provided. It is the user's responsibility to add the second Surveillance Objective to the corresponding Field Activities, Locations, Incidents, Source Records, and Specimens.

Another exception can occur when Source Records and Specimens collected during past surveillance efforts are included in future surveillance initiatives. For example, using pangolin Specimens collected by rangers patrolling a protected area in 2017 under a scanning surveillance strategy, that are tested in 2023 for SARS-CoV-2 as part of a targeted surveillance initiative. This last Surveillance Objective DOES NOT generate new Field Activities, Locations, or Incidents, but the  Specimens tested for SARS-CoV-2 and their Sources will have more than one Surveillance Objective. The one that originally demanded conducting the Field Activity to collect the Source Record and Specimens, and the new Surveillance Objective targeting SARS-CoV-2. 

Moreover, new Necropsies might be conducted during the Surveillance Objective targeting SARS-CoV-2, new Specimens could be created (from larger stored Specimens, such as a carcass or an organ), or new Pooled Specimens could be produced. All these components receive the Surveillance Objective targeting SARS-CoV-2 only. Again, it is the user's responsibility to add the second Surveillance Objective to the new Source Records and Specimens.

Each Diagnostic keeps a single Surveillance Objective (new Diagnostics targeting SARS-CoV-2 receive the SARS-CoV-2-related Surveillance Objective only). Surveillance Objectives added to a Diagnostic will be automatically provided to the corresponding Specimen, Source Record, and Source.

Therefore, a Surveillance Objective can be linked to others because they belong to the same Project; they requested the same Field Activities, Locations, and Incidents; or they have Sources and Specimens in common. If Surveillance Objectives are connected for the second and third reasons, then this connection must be provided in the metadata of the corresponding Surveillance Objectives. The connections will be also evident in the exported data such that each component with more than one Surveillance Objective (Field Activity,..., Specimens) will be represented by one row per Surveillance Objective.

## Outbreak Investigation

All Outbreak Investigations are a Surveillance Objective, although the outbreak information (name and diagnosis) can be provided after the Surveillance Objective creation in the database.
