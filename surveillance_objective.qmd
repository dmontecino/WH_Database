<!-- # Surveillance Activity {.unnumbered} -->

A Surveillance Activity in the data model refers to a set of activities to collect data with the aim of detecting, proving freedom of disease, measure incidence or prevalence, or assessing trends of specific health hazards within specific populations, using a standardized methodology. For example, the [longitudinal assessment of coronavirus shedding in two *Eidolon helvum* bat roosts in Africa](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0274490).

Surveillance Activities can encompass targeted surveillance, scanning surveillance, citizen science monitoring, freedom of disease assessments, ranger patrols, and others. An example is a capture-mark-recapture study targeting lead accumulation in a specific vulture population involving the collection of blood samples and conducting tests using the same capture, marking, and diagnostic methods. **Surveillance Activities include detailed metadata that describe their objectives and methods, including information on the targeted species, populations, hazards, type of Sources and Specimens, collection methods, Diagnostics, and case definitions for Diagnostics, Specimens, and Sources**. 

Field Visits, Locations, Events, Sources, Source Records, and Diagnostics usually belong to a single Surveillance Activity. The Surveillance Activity that commanded the Field Visits at different Locations to document Events, collect Sources and Specimens, perform Diagnostics for a specific hazard, and provide Diagnosis for Diagnostics, Specimens, and Sources. However, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, rodents trapped in the same Event may be sampled using the same methodology but tested for coronaviruses and Rickettsia *sp*. In this scenario, two Surveillance Activities should be assigned to the Field Visits, Locations, Events, Source Records, and Specimens. Diagnostics for either group of pathogens and the corresponding Diagnosis should only get a single Surveillance Activity. 

Another exception to this rule is the collection of Specimens from Sources that belonged to other Surveillance Activities. For example, marked rodents that were released, and later captured and tested for a specific hazard under Surveillance Activity A that were captured and sampled during Surveillance Activity B months later. In this case, these rodents will be part of two Surveillance Activities (A and B).

Another exception occurs when Specimens were collected during past surveillance efforts but are included in new surveillance initiatives. For instance, using pangolin Specimens collected by veterinarians in 2017 and tested for Salmonella sps. which are then tested in 2023 for SARS-CoV-2. In this case, the latter Surveillance Activity is assigned to the Specimens being tested (as a second Surveillance Activity) and to the SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostics and Diagnosis. Therefore, these Specimens should have two Surveillance Objectives. The first one corresponds to the original Surveillance Activity that lead to their collection and the second one corresponds to the Surveillance Activity testing them for SARS-CoV-2. The Source (pangolin) and the corresponding Record should keep a single Surveillance Activity.

Moreover, Necropsies might be conducted as part of a secondary Surveillance Activity (on a Carcass that was collected under other Surveillance Activity) or new Specimens could be created from a previously unused Carcass as part of a new Surveillance Activity. In this case, the new data (Necropsy and Specimens) should receive the second Surveillance Activity only. Diagnostics using the new Specimens should receive the second Surveillance Activity only. The Carcass should receive the Surveillance Activity that lead to its collection only.

Therefore, Surveillance Activities can be interconnected through the reuse of Specimens or expanding the data generated by previous Surveillance Activities. These connections will be evident in the exported data, where each component with multiple Surveillance Activities (e.g., Specimen) will be represented by one row per Surveillance Activity. 

## Outbreak Investigation

All outbreak investigations are considered Surveillance Activities. Outbreak Surveillance Activities can encompass the Field Visit that lead to the Outbreak detection and the following Field Visits associated with Outbreak investigation and control. The detection could have been made during a Field Activity conducted by rangers during their patrols. This initial Field Visit and its components should be assigned to a the ranger patrol Surveillance Activity and to the Outbreak Surveillance Activity. The following Field Activities that could be completed by veterinarians or public health officers receive the outbreak Surveillance Activity only.
