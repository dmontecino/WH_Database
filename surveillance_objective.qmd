<!-- # Surveillance Activity {.unnumbered} -->

A **Surveillance Activity** in the data model refers to a coordinated set of activities aimed at detect diseases, demonstrate disease freedom, measure incidence or prevalence, assess trends in specific health and health hazards within defined populations. In general, a specific set of methods, strategies, and objectives should equal a specific **Surveillance Activity**.

For example, the [longitudinal assessment of coronavirus shedding in two *Eidolon helvum* bat roosts in Africa](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0274490) involved collecting a fixed number of fecal samples from two bat roosts of the same species every month for 12 months, with subsequent testing for Coronaviridae sp.

Each **Surveillance Activity** includes detailed metadata describing its objectives and methods, such as:

* Targeted species, populations, and hazards
* Samples and collection methods
* Diagnostics and case definitions

A **Surveillance Activity** can span multiple **Field Visits**, **Locations**, and **Source** types (e.g., *Groups*, *Animals*, *Environmental* and *Arthropod* Sources).

Generally, **Field Visits, Locations, Events, Sources, Source Records, and Diagnostics belong to a single Surveillance Activity**. Furthermore, **a Surveillance Activity usually includes Field Visits, Locations, Events, Sources, Source Records, and Diagnostics**. However, exceptions exist (see Complexities section).

Most **Surveillance Activity** properties align with standard documentation of surveillance methods, including:

* Start and End Dates
* Targeted Hazards and Taxa
* Involved **Organizations**
* Definitions of **Locations**, **Events**, and **Sources**
* **Source** identification, **Specimens**, and **Collection** methods
* **Diagnostic** techniques and case definitions

## Outbreak Investigation

Each outbreak investigation is considered a **Surveillance Activity**. **Outbreak Surveillance Activities can encompass the initial Field Visit that led to the outbreak detection and subsequent Field Visits associated with the investigation and control**. For instance, an outbreak may first be detected during routine patrols by rangers. In such cases, the initial **Field Visit** and its components should be assigned to both the ranger patrol **Surveillance Activity** and also the **Outbreak Surveillance Activity**. Follow-up **Field Visits** (e.g., by veterinarians or public health officers investigating the outbreak) should be assigned exclusively to the **Outbreak Surveillance Activity** (see Complexities section).
