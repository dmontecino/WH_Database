<!-- # Specimens {.unnumbered} -->

#### Generalities

Specimens are tissue or material collected from Sources, other Specimens, and  Diagnostic products (See Diagnostics) to conduct Diagnostics and identify hazards or other potential health threats. **Specimens can originate from Sources at time *t*, but also from other Specimens, or Diagnostic Products**.

In the data model, a single Specimen can be composed of feces of a specific animal collected in the field mixed with water from a pond next to that Animal. Therefore, **Specimens can be created using tissue collected from many Sources of different types**. 

In the data model, a new Specimen can be created by mixing Specimens of any origin and Diagnostic Products. Therefore, **Specimens can originate by mixing Specimens, or by mixing Diagnostic Products, or by mixing Specimens and Diagnostic Products. These are "Pooled Specimens"**. 

Specimens are characterized by an identifier, the type of material (water, hair, kidney, animal), the original amount collected (e.g., 'full animal' or 0.35 mm), the current amount, their origin (Source Record, other Specimen, or Diagnostic Product), among others. Additionally, the data model can hold data on the storage location of Specimens (building, laboratory name, refrigerator name, etc.), their availability, ownership, current amount, and exportation processes (See Data Dictionary). 

Specimens without any amount of tissue left can be kept in the data model so the last storage, exportation processes, and its use in Diagnostic procedures can be tracked.

#### Specimens from Source Records 

Specimens can be tissue collected from Sources at time **t** (from Source Records). These Specimens can range from the entire body of a living animal to conduct an ultrasound to a minimal amount of fluid (e.g., blood) to perform advanced assays. An example of Group Source Specimen is feces collected from the bottom of a cage with animals of the same species but it is unknown which of the animals dropped the feces. An example of Animal Source Specimen is 2 ml of blood taken from a lion. An example of Environmental Source Specimen is 10 grams of soil collected from a specific site. An example of Arthropod Source Specimen is a set mosquitoes of the same species coming from the same trap type collection. In vector-borne disease surveillance, this last type of Specimen are usually called "pools". 

The data model does not accommodate Specimens that were collected after the last date a Source was observed. For example, it is possible to collect feces from an empty cage that a Group Source providing feces longitudinally was using until two days ago. In this case, the Specimen origin changes from the Group Source followed longitudinally to an Environmental Source (the cage). Using a clustering variable, it is possible to track that the Specimens are coming from the same cage, in one case with animals and in the last one without animals (clustering the Sources coming from the same cage). 

**An Group Source used directly for a Diagnostic (e.g., assessment of fat in carcasses of animals belonging to a specific herd) is not a Specimen**.

In the case of Animal Sources, new Specimens can be generated during a Necropsy (e.g., Specimens from the Carcass). In this case, the date of Specimen collection is not necessarily the date when the Animal Source was found, when the Carcass was collected, or when the animal died, but the date of the Necropsy (primary or secondary). It is possible to track if a Specimen was collected during the primary or secondary Necropsy based on the information entered for Specimens. **An Animal Source used directly for a Diagnostic (e.g., X-rays in a live animal) is not a Specimen**

In the case of Environmental Sources, its type determines the Specimen type. For example, a pond of water can only yield Specimens of type "water".

#### Specimens from Diagnostic Products

Products generated by Diagnostic methods applied to a regular Specimen can be stored and used as Specimen in further Diagnostics (e.g., use cDNA created to complete Diagnostic A in a new RT-PCR Diagnostic B). The data model can accommodate Diagnostic Products to be use in future Diagnostics. In this case, the origin of these new "Specimens" is a specific Diagnostic and not a Source Record,m and its type is "Diagnostic Product". The remaining properties of the new Specimen from a Diagnostic Product are the same (see Data Dictionary).

#### Pooled Specimens 

Specimens can be created by mixing other Specimens of any origin. For example, mixing a Specimen from a Diagnostic Product, a Specimen from an Arthropod Source, a Specimen from an Animal Source, and a Specimen from an Environmental Source. The origin of Pooled Specimens is tracked in the data model. In the example, the origin will be associated with four Specimens. The remaining properties are the same (see Data Dictionary). 

#### Specimens in Containers

In situations where space or materials are limited, it is possible that multiple Specimens are stored in a unique container. This approach is clearly not ideal because it can lead to cross-contamination and make actual Specimen tracing more complex. To address the tracing of these Specimens, a unique container identifier, such as a jar identifier, can be provided to the Specimen (see Data Dictionary). Specific properties for each individual Specimen within the container, such as type, quantity, etc, should allow their visual identification within the container.
