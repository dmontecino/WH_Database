# Specimens {.unnumbered}

Specimens refer to the materials collected from Source Records for the purpose of conducting Diagnostics to identify hazards (biological, chemical, physical) or physiological problems. Specimens can range from the entire body of a living animal for conducting an ultrasound on to a minimal amount of tissue to perform advanced assays.

Specimens are characterized by an identifier, the type of material (water, hair, kidney, animal), the original amount (e.g., 'full animal' or 0.35 mm), the solution used for preservation, and the storage type in the field and in the storage location. Additionally, the database tracks the strorage location of the Specimens (building, laboratory name, refrigerator name, etc.), their availability, ownership, and current amount. It is important to note that the original amount and the current amount of a Specimen may differ if a portion of the original Specimen has already been used for Diagnostics.

For Animal Specimens that are equivalent to the Animal Source Record (both representing the 'full animal'), information should be provided at both the Source Record and Specimen levels. The Source Record and Specimen can have the same identifier or different identifiers, and the amount of the Specimen in such cases should be indicated as 'full animal'.

Invertebrate Source Records may include multiple species; however, it is expected that the Specimens associated with these Records only contain invertebrates of the same species.

Specimens with a current amount of zero should not be deleted from the database, and their last known storage location should be retained.

In situations where space or materials are limited, it is possible that multiple Specimens are stored in the same container. This approach is not ideal because it can lead to cross-contamination and make actual Specimen tracing more complex. To address the tracing of these Specimens, a unique container identifier, such as a jar identifier, can be added in the database. Specimens sharing the same container will have the same container identifier. Although individual Specimens within the same container may not be labeled individually, each Specimen should be given a unique Specimen Code in the database. This Code can be the same as the container identifier, followed by the "organ name" or a numeric string (e.g., ".1", ".2", etc.). Specific details for each individual Specimen within the container, such as type, quantity, etc, should allow their visual identification within the container.
