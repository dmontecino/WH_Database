### Generalities

In the data model, Specimens are tissue or material from Sources Records used to conduct Diagnostics (See Diagnostics) and identify hazards or other potential health threats in the corresponding Sources. Furthermore, Specimens can be stored in a facility and the current site where the Specimens are, as well as their historical movements among facilities can be traced.

Specimens are characterized by Specimen ID, Specimen Type, Specimen Original Amount, Specimen Current, their Origin, Storage building, Storage laboratory name, Storage refrigerator name, Ownership, among others (see Data Dictionary). 

**The data model does not accommodate Specimens that were collected after the last date a Source was observed**. For example, it is possible to collect feces from an empty cage that a Group Source providing feces longitudinally was using until two days ago. In this case, the Specimen does not belong to the Group Source but to an Environmental Source (the cage). The connection between both Specimens coming from the cage with and withput animals can be made using cluster variables (see Complexities below).

Specimens without any amount of tissue left remain in the data model so the last storage, exportation processes, and its use in Diagnostic procedures can be traced.

### Specimens from Animal and Group Source Records 

An example of Group Source Specimen are feces collected from the bottom of a cage with animals of the same species but it is unknown which of the animals dropped the feces. An example of Animal Source Specimen is 2 ml of blood taken from a lion. 

**A Group Source used directly for a Diagnostic (e.g., assessment of fat in carcasses of animals belonging to a specific herd) or an Animal Source used directly for a Diagnostic (e.g., ultrasound in an animal) are not Specimens (see Sources And Source Records**. 

In the case of Animal Sources, new Specimens can be generated during a Necropsy (e.g., Specimens from the Carcass). In this case, the date of Specimen collection is not necessarily the date when the Animal Source was found, when the Carcass was collected, or when the animal died, but the date of the Necropsy (primary or secondary). It is possible to track if a Specimen was collected during the primary or secondary Necropsy based on the information entered for Specimens.

### Specimens from Environmental Source Records 

An example of Environmental Source Specimen is 10 grams of soil collected from a specific site (Environmental Source). Another useful example are feces found in the field at time *t* (Source Record) at a specific site (Source). 

In this second example it is possible to: i) collect the full feces or ii) take swabs from it. In the former case, the feces are the Source Record and the Specimen (the Specimen can be stored. The Source Record cannot be Stored). In the latter, the feces are just the Source Record whilst the swabs are the Specimens.

In the case of **Environmental Specimens, its type is determined by the type of the Specimen Source Record**. For example, water collected at time *t* (Environmental Source Record) from a pond (Environmental Source) can only yield Specimens of type "water".


### Specimens from Arthropod Source Records 

An example of Arthropod Source Specimen is the set mosquitoes of the same species coming from the same Collection. These are basically sub-groups of the mosquitoes present in the corresponding Source Record. In vector-borne disease surveillance, this last type of Specimen is usually called "pools". 

### Special Cases

#### Specimens from a mix of Source types

An example: a bat is swabbed in its oral cavity and in its rectum but then the swabs are placed together in a tube and consider a single Specimen. Then, there is a single Specimen type: two oro-rectal swabs in a tube container but with a single Source Record origin. 

It is possible also to get blood from two bats and mix it. The data model can accommodate this case because **Specimens can have multiple Source Record origins**. In the example, both bled bats are the origin of a single Specimen consisting in mm of blood.

Similarly, **it is possible to generate a Specimen by mixing tissue from Source Records of different type**. For example, the blood (tissue) of a bat captured at time *t* (Animal Source Record) with the feces (tissue) collected from the bottom of the roost of the same bat at time *t* (Group Source Record). In this case, the mixed tissue (blood from an Animal Source and Feces from a Group Source) can be included in the data model as a single Specimen with two Source Records as origin. If the feces from the roost collected from the bottom of the roost were also recorded as a Specimen by themselves, then this Specimen also has two origins: the Group Source (the bats in the roost) and the bled bat who also belongs to the roost.

**The key here is that Specimens are generated by mixing tissue coming from different Source Records, which is different than mixing Specimens**. In the data model, mixing Specimens means mixing data Units already documented (see next). 

#### Pooled Specimens 

Specimens can be created by mixing other Specimens of any origin. For example, mixing a Specimen from an Arthropod Source, a Specimen from an Animal Source, and a Specimen from an Environmental Source. The origin of Pooled Specimens is tracked in the data model. In the example, the origin of the Specimen is three Specimens. The remaining properties are the same (see Data Dictionary). 

#### Specimens from Diagnostic Products

Products generated by a Diagnostic method (see Diagnostics below) can be stored and used as Specimen in further Diagnostics (e.g., use cDNA created as part of Diagnostic A used in a new RT-PCR, Diagnostic B). The data model can accommodate Diagnostic Products to be used as Specimens in future Diagnostics. In this case, the origin of these new "Specimens" is a specific Diagnostic and not a Source Record, and its type is a diagnostic product such as cDNA. The properties of a Specimen from a Diagnostic Product are the same (see Data Dictionary).

Diagnostic Products as Specimens can be mixed with other Specimens also to create new Pooled Specimens. Diagnostic Products not included in the set of Specimens available cannot be mixed with other tissues to create new Specimens. In other words, Diagnostic Products must be added to the data model as a Specimen, so this Specimen can be pooled with other Specimens.

#### Specimens in Containers

In situations where space or materials are limited, it is possible that multiple Specimens are stored in a unique container. This approach is clearly not ideal because it can lead to cross-contamination and make actual Specimen tracing more complex. To address the tracing of these Specimens, a Container Identifier is a property of Specimens (see Data Dictionary). Specific properties for each individual Specimen within the container, such as type, quantity, etc, should allow their visual identification within the container.
