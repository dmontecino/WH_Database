# Specimens {.unnumbered}

Specimens correspond to material collected from Source Records to conduct Diagnostics in order to identify hazards (Biological, Chemical, Physical) or Physiological problems. The material collected can range from the full body to conduct an ultrasound in a live animal up to a trace of tissue to perform a highly technological assay.

Specimens are characterized by an identifier, the type of material (water, hair, kidney, animal), the original amount (e.g., 'full animal' or 0.35 mm), the solution used to maintain them, and their storage type in the laboratory. Moreover, the database tracks the Specimen location (building, laboratory name, refrigerator name, etc), their availability, ownership, and current amount. The original amount and the current amount can differ if a certain quantity of the original Specimen has already been used for previous Diagnostics.

Animal Specimens that are equivalent to the Animal Source Record (both are the 'full animal') must be given information at the Source Record level and at the Specimen level. The Source Record and Specimen could have the same identifier or a different one. The amount of the Specimen in those cases should be 'full animal'.

Invertebrate Source Records can have multiple species; however, it is expected that their Specimens only contain invertebrates belonging to the same species.

Specimens whose current amount is zero must not be deleted from the database and their last location should remain.

It is possible that for lack of space or materials, more than one Specimen is stored in the same container. This strategy can cause cross-contamination and make Specimen tracing more complicated. For this reason, Specimens can belong to a 'container' (e.g., a jar) that has a unique identifier. This container identifier is the same among Specimens sharing the same container. Although Specimens within the same container might not be labeled individually, they must be given a unique Specimen identifier in the database. This identifier can be the same as the container identifier plus "organ name" or a numeric string at the end: ".1", ".2", etc. A description of each specific 'Specimen' within the container can be provided in 'Comments' allowing the identification of each tissue in the container as the corresponding Specimen.
