### Surveillance Activities

Initially, it was mentioned that "**Field Visits, Locations, Events, Sources, Source Records, and Diagnostics usually belong to a single Surveillance Activity**. This is the Surveillance Activity that lead to the Field Visits at different Locations to document Events, collect Sources and Specimens, perform Diagnostics for a specific hazard, and provide Diagnosis for Diagnostics, Specimens, and Sources".

Furthermore, it was established that "**a Surveillance Activity usually includes Field Visits, Locations, Events, Sources, Source Records, and Diagnostics**". 

Here it is explained what are the exceptions to these two general statements and how the data model can handle them. 

#### Field Visits up to Specimen belong to two or more Surveillance Activities

![](Pictures_and_diagrams/Picture12.png){width=100%}

Two or more Surveillance Activities used the exact same methodology except for the Diagnostics (they target different hazards but the diagnostics are conducted using the same specimens). For example, the same rodents are trapped and sampled but they are tested for coronaviruses as part of Surveillance Activity 1 and Rickettsia *sp* as part of Surveillance Activity 2. In this case the Field Visits, Locations, Events, Collections, Source Records, and Specimens, belong to both Surveillance Activities. Instead, the Diagnostics and Diagnosis belong to one of them only. 


#### Field Visits up to Source Records belong to two or more Surveillance Activities

This can happen when two or more Surveillance Activities overlap in their Field Visits up to Source Records but the Specimens up to Diagnostics are different. For example, the same rodents are trapped and sampled during the same Collection but Surveillance Activity 1 uses rectal swabs to test for coronaviruses whilst Surveillance Activity 2 uses blood for Rickettsia *sp*. In this case the Field Visits, Locations, Events, Collections, and Source Records belong to both Surveillance Activities. Instead, the Specimens, Diagnostics, and Diagnosis belong to one of them only. 

#### Field Visits up to Collections belong to two or more Surveillance Activities

This can happen when two or more Surveillance Activities overlap in their Field Visits up to Collections but the Source Records up to Diagnostics are different. For example, bats are collected at the same; however, only Megabats are tested for Ebola as part of Surveillance Activity 1. Instead, only Microbats are tested for coronaviruses as part of Surveillance Activity 2. In this case the Field Visits, Locations, Events, and Collections belong to both Surveillance Activities. Instead, the Source Records, Specimens, Diagnostics, and Diagnosis belong to one of them only. 

#### Field Visits up to Events belong to two or more Surveillance Activities

![](Pictures_and_diagrams/Picture15.png){width=100%}

This can happen when two or more Surveillance Activities overlap in their Field Visits up to Events, but the Collection up to Diagnostics are different because they have different goals. For example, water is collected from Event A as part of Surveillance Activity 1 and a mosquitos are also collected from Event A as part of Surveillance Activity 2. In this case the Field Visits, Locations, and Events belong to both Surveillance Activities. Instead, the Collections, Source Records, Specimens, Diagnostics, and Diagnosis belong to one of them only. 

#### Field Visits and to Locations belong to two or more Surveillance Activities

![](Pictures_and_diagrams/Picture16.png){width=100%}

This can happen when two or more Surveillance Activities overlap in their Field Visits and Locations but the Events up to Diagnostics are different. For example, Surveillance Activity 1 aims to capture bats using mist nets and Surveillance  Activity 1 aims to capture rodents. The Field Visit and the Locations could be the same but the capturing of the bats can occur at night and the capture of rodents can occur early morning. In this case the Field Visits and Locations belong to both Surveillance Activities. Instead, the Events, Collections, Source Records, Specimens, Diagnostics, and Diagnosis belong to one of them only.

#### Field Visits belong to two or more Surveillance Activities

This can happen when two or more Surveillance Activities overlap in their Field Visits but the Locations up to Diagnostics are different. Field Visit can be common because it facilitates logistics. For example, coming back from the forest after collecting chimpanzee urine as part of Surveillance Activity 1 and on the way back, go to a Rehabilitation Center and sampled animals there as part of Surveillance Activity 2. 


#### Surveillance Activity contains only Diagnostics and Diagnosis

This can happen when Surveillance Activity 2 uses Specimens collected as part of Surveillance Activity 1 to test them again for the same or different hazard. For example, Specimens from bats collected ten years ago will be used in a new study to test them for SARS-CoV-2. The Diagnostics are the only new entity generated as part of Surveillance Activity 2.

#### Surveillance Activity contains only Specimens, Diagnostics and Diagnosis

![](Pictures_and_diagrams/Picture19.png){width=100%}

This can happen Surveillance Activity 2 generates new Specimens from a carcass of a Source Record collected as part of Surveillance Activity 1 and tests these new Specimens for a hazard. For example, a carcass of a bat collected ten years ago will be used in a new study, Surveillance Activity 2, to get a new Specimen and test it for SARS-CoV-2. The new Specimen and the new Diagnostic belong to Surveillance Activity 2.







<!-- #### Only the Source Record and Specimens belong to two or more Surveillance Activities -->

<!-- This can happen Surveillance Activity 2 uses the carcass of a Source Record, collected as part of Surveillance Activity 1 to get new Specimens and test them for a hazard but also uses Specimens collected as part of Surveillance Activity 1 to test it for the same hazard. For example, a carcass of a bat collected ten years ago will be used in a new study, Surveillance Activity 2, to get a new Specimen and test it for SARS-CoV-2. Specimens from the bats collected 10 years ago will also be used to test them for SARS-CoV-2. The new Specimen and the new Diagnostic belong to Surveillance Activity 2, the Source Record and the old Specimens to both Surveillance Activities, and the corresponding Field Activity up to Collection belong to Surveillance Activity 1. -->



<!-- Another exception to this rule is the collection of Specimens from Sources that belonged to other Surveillance Activities. For example, marked rodents that were released, and later captured and tested for a specific hazard under Surveillance Activity A that were captured and sampled during Surveillance Activity B months later. In this case, these rodents will be part of two Surveillance Activities (A and B). -->

<!-- Another exception occurs when Specimens were collected during past surveillance efforts but are included in new surveillance initiatives. For instance, using pangolin Specimens collected by veterinarians in 2017 and tested for Salmonella sps. which are then tested in 2023 for SARS-CoV-2. In this case, the latter Surveillance Activity is assigned to the Specimens being tested (as a second Surveillance Activity) and to the SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostics and Diagnosis. Therefore, these Specimens should have two Surveillance Objectives. The first one corresponds to the original Surveillance Activity that lead to their collection and the second one corresponds to the Surveillance Activity testing them for SARS-CoV-2. The Source (pangolin) and the corresponding Record should keep a single Surveillance Activity. -->

<!-- Moreover, Necropsies might be conducted as part of a secondary Surveillance Activity (on a Carcass that was collected under other Surveillance Activity) or new Specimens could be created from a previously unused Carcass as part of a new Surveillance Activity. In this case, the new data (Necropsy and Specimens) should receive the second Surveillance Activity only. Diagnostics using the new Specimens should receive the second Surveillance Activity only. The Carcass should receive the Surveillance Activity that lead to its collection only. -->

<!-- Finally, the health of the same animal could be assessed under different Surveillance Activities. For example, a ranger that finds a sick animal in a specific date and assess it health and potential cause of disease. Then, the animal is taken to a rehabilitation center where its health is assessed again at admission and samples are collected for testing. Finally, the animal health at the rehabilitation center can be assessed again later and more sampled could be taken in order to learn what pathogens are circulating within the facility. This animal has been part of three potential Surveillance Activities, each with different target populations and methods. To track the path of this animal, each Field Visit (ranger patrolling, the admission at the rehabilitation center, and the sampling at admission) should be part of one Surveillance Activity only. The Locations within each Field Activity (a protected area, the rehabilitation center, and the rehabilitation center), should be part of the first, the second, and third Surveillance Activities only. Each Event at each Location, (when it was found originally in the protected area, examined at admission to the rehabilitation center, and then sampled after admission) should be part of a single Surveillance Activity,  -->


<!-- it should receive the three Surveillance Activities. Each Event (when it was found originally, examined at admission to the rehabilitation center, and then sampled after admission) should be part of a single Surveillance Activity, the Locations (a protected area and the rehabilitation center), should be part of one and two Surveillance Activities, respectively correspondingly,  -->

<!-- Therefore, Surveillance Activities can be interconnected through the reuse of Specimens or expanding the data generated by previous Surveillance Activities. These connections will be evident in the exported data, where each component with multiple Surveillance Activities (e.g., Specimen) will be represented by one row per Surveillance Activity.  -->





<!-- Other option is animals in a pen. Feces known to be dropped by animal A can be collected, as well as feces from the pen floor whose specific individual source is unknown, but it is known that the animals in the pen dropped them (including animal B)-> Animal Source A -> feces 1 and Animal Source A + Group Source A -> feces 2 -->


<!-- **Specimens can originate from Sources at time *t*, but also from other Specimens, or Diagnostic Products**. -->

<!-- For example, it is possible to collect feces from an empty cage that a Group Source providing feces longitudinally was using until two days ago. In this case, the Specimen origin changes from the Group Source followed longitudinally to an Environmental Source (the cage). Using a clustering variable, it is possible to track that the Specimens are coming from the same cage, in one case with animals and in the last one without animals (clustering the Sources coming from the same cage).  -->
